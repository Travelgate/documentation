# **Develop a Connector**

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **API Review** - When implementing a Connector, it is essential to review the supplier's API to ensure compatibility with Travelgate's Connectors format.
   
   *This step is typically handled by a Travelgate developer.*

   ### **Key Points to Analyze**
   - **Is the API for hotel products?**
   - **Does it include a search operation?**
     - The API must allow searching for options (rooms) based on occupancy, hotel codes, and check-in dates. This corresponds to the **Search** operation in Connectors.
   - **Does it include a quote operation?**
     - The API must allow confirming an option's characteristics or cancellation policies. This corresponds to the **Quote** operation.
     - **Note**: If the API does not have a dedicated quote call, and search ensures that the optionâ€™s price and policies will not change, a second search can act as a quote. 
       - [Repeat Flow Operations](../Connector_Framework/Repeat_Flow_Operations.mdx).
   - **Does it include a book operation?**
     - The API must allow confirming a booking with passenger names. This corresponds to the **Book** operation.
   - **Does it include a cancel operation?**
     - The API must allow canceling a booking. This corresponds to the **Cancel** operation.
   - **Does it include a query by reference operation?**
     - If the API allows querying a booking by buyer or seller reference, this corresponds to the **CheckBookingsByReference** operation. 
     - *Note*: This operation is optional but required by many buyers.
   - **Does it include a query by date range operation?**
     - If the API allows listing bookings by check-in date or booking date range, this corresponds to the **CheckBookingsByDates** operation. 
     - *Note*: This operation is optional but highly recommended for many buyers.

   #### Preoperations
   It is also necessary to determine if preoperations are required. For example:
   - **Search**:
     - Some APIs require a login call to generate a session token before performing the search.
   - **Quote**:
     - Often requires a second search or multiple calls to fetch cancellation policies and prices.
   - **Book**:
     - May require a second quote to confirm price and availability before booking.

   ### **For Suppliers Developing Their Own API**
   If you are a supplier creating your own API, you will need to provide:
   - API documentation for integration.
   - Required credentials.
   - A designated technical contact for support and troubleshooting.

2. **Credentials** - Obtain the necessary authentication details.
3. **Technical Contact** - Ensure a direct communication line with the technical team.

## **Start a Connector**

### **Step 1: Define the Binder (AccessModels)**
The first step is to define the parameters required by the supplier. Analyze the API and credentials provided to identify if any **custom parameters** are needed. 
- [View AccessData Documentation](../Access_Data/AccessData.mdx)

### **Step 2: Review the Provided Project**
Travelgate provides a template project with:
- Operations defined but unimplemented (e.g., methods throwing `NotImplementedException`).
- Empty models (requests and responses) for each supplier operation.

#### **Example**
Unimplemented method in an operation:
```csharp
public bool TryValidateModelRequest(
    SearchConnectorRequest connectorsRequest, 
    SearchParameters<CntAccessModel> connectorParameters,
    out IEnumerable<AdviseMessage> adviseMessages)
{
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}
```

### **Step 3: Implement Operations**
1. Implement the models for the supplier's requests and responses for a specific operation.
2. Define the methods for that operation.
3. Add the appropriate serializer type (JSON, XML) in the **Extensions** class.

### **Step 4: Implement Preoperations (If Needed)**
If preoperations are required (e.g., login, token refresh), implement them and register them in the **Extensions**.

[View PreOperations Overview](../Connector_Framework/PreOperation_Overview.mdx)

## **Testing the Implementation**

### **Option 1: Connector Integration Tests**
Use the integration tests provided by Travelgate to validate your implementation:
- Add the necessary use cases to the **MockServer** for each operation.
  - [View MockServer Documentation](../Connector_Framework/MockServer_Documentation.mdx).
- Execute the associated tests for the implemented operation.
  - [View Running Integration Tests](../Connector_Framework/Running_Integration_Tests.mdx).

### **Option 2: FormTest Tool**
Use the **FormTest** application to test each operation manually:
- Configure the tool to use your supplier's API settings.
- Test specific scenarios not covered by predefined use cases.
  - [View FormTest Documentation](../Tools_and_Helpers/FormTest_Documentation.mdx).
