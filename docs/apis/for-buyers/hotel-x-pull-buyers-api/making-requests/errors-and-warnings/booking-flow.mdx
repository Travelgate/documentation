# Booking flow and management

Hotel-X can return errors or warnings as the severity of these issues can vary. These errors or warnings may be directly generated by the Hotel-X API layer, or they could be transmitted from the Seller's system in cases where they encounter errors on their end.

Below, you will find the list of the possible values that you will receive.

### Errors List

Errors are situations where the service has been terminated for some reason. Each error returned by the Hotel-X API layer has an alphabetic code and a type. Here, you will find the various options and their explanations.

| Code                 | Type             | Description                       | Explanation   |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ACCESS_ERROR         | VALIDATION_ERROR | No valid accesses found           | The access is not found or it has no permission, or you are using a test access and you need to add the  `testMode` field to "true".      |
| MISSING_FIELD        | VALIDATION_ERROR | _Depending on the scenario_       | Some mandatory fields are missing in input.                                 |
| WRONG_FIELD          | VALIDATION_ERROR | _Depending on the scenario_       | A field or fields in the request are not correct.                           |
| ALL_PROCESSES_FAILED | PROCESS_ERROR    | See warnings for more information | This happens when our system has to make more than one request to the supplier's system. For example, in a search query, if we're checking availability for many hotels or suppliers, or in a booking query when we're asking about reservations for multiple bookings. If none of these requests get a successful response, we show this error. You can find more details about why it happened in the warning message. Sometimes, it can also happen if there's something wrong with the default settings.   |
| OPTION_NOT_FOUND     | PROCESS_ERROR    | _Depending on the scenario_       | Option not found in quote. This occurs when the option's status has changed between the search response and the quote response.  |
| INTERNAL_ERROR       | API_ERROR        | _Depending on the scenario_       | Covers any unexpected error or errors due to internal service.              |
| NOT_IMPLEMENTED      | API_ERROR        | _Depending on the scenario_       | The requested operation is currently unavailable and has not been implemented for this supplier integration.             |
| TIMEOUT              | CONNECTION_ERROR | _Depending on the scenario_       | This occurs due to a connection timeout.                                    |
| INTERNAL_ERROR       | REQUEST_CANCELED | _Depending on the scenario_       | Request has been cancelled and connection has been cut.                     |

### Warning List

Warnings are potentially harmful situations or errors that do not require the service to be terminated. Warnings can originate from either the Hotel-X layer or the Seller's system. In the case of a warning from the Hotel-X layer, the code and type can be as follows:

#### Hotel-X Warnings

| Code                 | Type             | Description                                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WRONG_FIELD          | PLUGIN_ERROR     | _Depending on the scenario_                   | Occurs when the plugin input is incorrect or improperly structured.                                               |
| BLACKLIST            | PLUGIN_ERROR     | _Depending on the scenario_                   | Occurs when one or more hotels or accesses are blacklisted.                                                       |
| MAPPING_NOT_FOUND    | MAPPING_ERROR    | _Depending on the scenario_                   | The option couldn’t be processed because mapping codes are missing for the supplier context.                      |
| INTERNAL_ERROR       | MAPPING_ERROR    | _Depending on the scenario_                   | Internal error occurred while processing mapping codes — usually related to hotel mapping.                        |
| COMMISSION_NOT_FOUND | API_ERROR        | _Depending on the scenario_                   | Occurs when options are discarded because the supplier returned a negative commission, preventing net price calculation. You need to upload a valid commission file to resolve it. |
| EMPTY_PRICE          | API_ERROR        | Supplier hasn't returned a price; fallback used. | The supplier didn’t provide a booking price in the booking response, so the system returns the price from the Quote step instead. |
| NOT_IMPLEMENTED      | API_ERROR        | _Depending on the scenario_                   | The requested operation is not currently supported or implemented for this supplier connector.                   |
| REFERENCE_NOT_EXISTS | BOOKING_ERROR    | Supplier has not returned any booking with this reference. | Occurs when the provided booking reference does not exist in the supplier’s system.                              |
| _Depends on the App_ | APPSHUB_ERROR    | _Depending on the scenario_                   | Occurs when an active App used in your booking flow returns a specific warning message.                           |
