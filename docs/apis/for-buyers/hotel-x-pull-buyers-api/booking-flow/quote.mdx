# Quote

Quote operation evaluates the rate before booking, providing the same information as the Search response for a hotel rate, including up-to-date pricing and cancellation policies. The returned fields include:

* `status`
* `price`
* `cancelPolicy`
* `rooms`
* `surcharges`


:::caution Important  
The information retrieved in **Quote**, such as pricing and policies, is always the most up-to-date and takes precedence over the data from **Search**.  

Availability, prices, and conditions may change between Search and Quote, so make sure to always rely on Quote for the latest details.

## Query Overview

When creating your quote query, you have two different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings

```graphql
query {
    hotelX {
    quote
      criteria: {}
      settings: {}
	}
}
```

<CautionSettingsHotelX />

### 1. Criteria 

This query offers versatility in quote options, with certain fields marked as mandatory (`optionRefId`) and others as optional (`language`). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Quote Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. 

To specify your quote criteria you need to use the input `HotelCriteriaQuoteInput` in your query variables:


```js
{
		"optionRefId": "13[%!03!~|3[%@241028!~|241029!~|1!~|1!~|0!~|ES!~|ES!~|es!~|EUR!~|0!~|2!~|1!~|1!~|1!~|0!~|15091141!~|BAR[%@BAR!~|146[%@0[%@false[%@EUR[%@[%@0[%@!~|1|30#30|1|2024-10-28|1|4132467|4132468|1|11|0!~|2269[%!2269!~|30[%@30!~|!~|Double Standard!~|1!~|!~|mercado[%@ES[%!ExpireDate[%@29/10/2024[%!tarifaNRF[%@true[%!RateRule[%@tarifaNoRefundablePorHabitacion!~|OK!~|Sith!~|0!~|"
}
```

**Mandatory criteria:**
* `optionRefId` (Identifier of the option chosen in Search)

**Optional criteria:**
* `language`


### 2. Settings 

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. By default, we apply the same configuration to all Hotel-X clients.

To specify your quote settings you need to use the [`HotelSettingsInput` input](/api/types/inputs/hotel-settings-input) in your query variables:

```js
{
	"settings": {
		"client": "client_demo",
		"context": "HOTELTEST",
		"testMode": true,
		"auditTransactions": false,
		"timeout": 10000
	}
}
```


**Mandatory Settings:**
* `client`
* `context` (You have the flexibility to choose between using the supplier's context or your own, depending on which codes you want to see in the response. If you prefer to receive responses with your custom codes, please ensure that your context code is linked to the mapping files that you've previously uploaded to your FTP account.)
* `timeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for the supplier connection. Won't close client connection if exceeded.)

**Optional Settings:**
* `group`
* `auditTransactions` 
* `suppliers` (Each one contains its own code, settings and accesses.)
* `plugins`
* `testMode` (This flag allows only the accesses checked as test.)
* `clientTokens` (Used to identify the origin of the request, this is only used with some [plugins](../plugins/overview).)
* `businessRules`


:::tip Key Recommendations

* Customize the `timeout` according to your needs, taking into consideration **the maximum values in Quote is 180,000ms**.

* Set the `audiTransaction` to "true" in Quote when investigating errors.

### Response Considerations

As mentioned earlier, the quote response will provide you with updated information about the option you selected during the search step. In this quote response, **there are some essential details that you should carefully review and consider** when providing information to your final customers:

* **Cancellation Policies:** Within the `cancelPolicy` structure response, you will find a `refundable` field. If this field is marked as "false," it means that the room has a 100% cancellation cost, making it non-refundable.

* **Remarks:** Pay attention to any remarks or additional notes provided in the response.

* **Surcharges (taxes):** Ensure you are aware of any applicable surcharges or taxes associated with the selected option.
