# Mapping at Travelgate

At Travelgate, we use our own standardized codes — called **FastX codes** — which serve as the **default identifiers** across the entire Marketplace. These codes are unique for each hotel, board, and room, allowing Buyers to connect with multiple Sellers quickly and efficiently through a single, unified system.

In both static content and booking flow responses, Travelgate always returns **two sets of codes**:

* The **FastX codes** (standardized across all Suppliers).
* The **Supplier native codes** (for full transparency and traceability).

This means Buyers can choose to:

* Work exclusively with **FastX codes**, gaining instant access to all connected Sellers without mapping each one individually.
* Or continue using **Supplier native codes**, if preferred, maintaining their own mapping logic.

To map FastX codes, Buyers can either handle it internally or use third-party mapping services such as **GIATA**.

:::tip Why FastX?
FastX eliminates the need for repetitive mapping, reduces connection time, and ensures consistency across all Suppliers — enabling faster integrations and more reliable data across the Travelgate Marketplace.

### How Many Properties Should I Map?

You have the flexibility to choose how many hotels to map. We recommend that you contact the Seller directly to confirm which hotels should be mapped based on your business needs. This approach helps avoid unnecessary requests and can reduce your L2B (Look-to-Book) ratio.

### Can I Obtain the Total Count of Rooms, Boards, and Categories at a Hotel Level?

Unfortunately, it’s not possible to retrieve this information at the hotel level. Content queries provide static information from Suppliers as a whole, rather than specific hotel details. You’ll receive the total count of rooms, boards, destinations, and categories associated with your credentials for a specific Seller.

### How Can I Use My Own Hotel Codes?

If you’re a Buyer connected to our Hotel-X Buyers API, you have the option to upload your own mapping files to our SFTP and use your own hotel codes. For more information, you can check our article on Hotel-X Mapping [here](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/mapping).

### How Can I Use the Supplier Hotel Codes?

By default, Travelgate uses **FastX codes** in all booking flows. However, if you prefer to use a Seller’s **native hotel codes**, you can do so by specifying it in your search request.

To use native codes, include the following in your **Search Query**:

* The **supplier hotel code** (the ID of the Seller you want to query).
* The **`context` field**, indicating the Supplier’s context.

This tells Travelgate that you want to run the search and booking flow using the Supplier’s original codes instead of FastX codes.

:::warning Hotel code concatenation
When a Seller returns the same hotel ID for multiple properties, we **concatenate** those IDs with their destination code to make them unique. This is the only situation where we modify the Supplier’s information.

In this case, the `hotelCode` returned by our API will be the concatenated ID, while the `hotelCodeSupplier` will be the Seller’s native code.

Always map the **"hotelCode"**, as this is the code used in Travelgate methods.

### Can We Use Universally Unique Identifier Codes (UUIDs) in Our Mapping?

Yes! We do not impose any limitations on the number or type of characters used in mapping the Supplier's hotel codes.

### Can I Map Different Portfolios for the Same Connection?

Yes, you can map multiple portfolios for the same connection (e.g., B2B, B2C, or different markets). As long as **each portfolio is provided by the Seller through a specific Hotel-X Access Code** (a unique set of credentials), you can map them independently.
