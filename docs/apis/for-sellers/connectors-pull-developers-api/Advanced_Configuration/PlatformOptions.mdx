# PlatformOptions

The `PlatformOptions` class defines configuration settings for the Connector. It allows for fine-tuning behavior for each operation, such as `Search`, `Quote`, `Book`, `CheckBookings`, and `Cancel`. These configurations are essential for adapting the Connector to specific supplier requirements and ensuring compliance with Travelgate standards.

---
## **Purpose**

The `PlatformOptions` class is used to:
- Configure behavior like IP filtering for suppliers using a `ConnectorsHttpClient`.
- Specify when secondary operations, like a `Search` during `Quote` or a `Quote` during `Book`, are required.
- Ensure supplier-specific restrictions and requirements are adhered to during Connector operations.

---
## **Key Configurations**

### **ConnectorsHttpClient**
- Used for suppliers that require IP-based filtering.
- A `ConnectorsHttpClient` is specified for each operation to ensure requests originate from the correct IP.
- Available options:
  - `Default`: Standard HTTP client without IP filtering.
  - `DefaultProxy`: Filters requests through a proxy IP. Usefull when the supplier filter's by IP.
  - `ProxyPCI`: (Deprecated) Not in use.

### **Repeat Flow Operation Required**

Defines the conditions under which repeating an operation is required during another operation. Possible values include:

- **`Never`**: A repeat operation is not required.
- **`Always`**: A repeat operation is always required.
- **`OnExpiration`**: A repeat operation is required when the previous search results have expired.
- **`OnErrorExpiration`**: A repeat operation is required only when an expiration-specific error occurs.

**Note:** For example, a 'Search' operation might be required during `Quote` or `Book` operations. Possible values include:

## **Example Configuration**

Here is an example of a fully configured `PlatformOptions`:

```csharp
return new PlatformOptions
{
    Search = new SearchOptions
    {
        ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
    },
    Quote = new QuoteOptions
    {
        ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
        SearchRequired = new SearchRequired
        {
            When = SearchRequiredWhen.Always
        }
    },
    Book = new BookOptions
    {
        ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
        QuoteRequired = new QuoteRequired
        {
            When = QuoteRequiredWhen.Never
        }
    },
    CheckBookings = new CheckBookingsOptions
    {
        ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
    },
    Cancel = new CancelOptions
    {
        ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default
    }
};
```

## **Connector**

To apply the `PlatformOptions`, inject the configuration into the Connector startup using the provided extension method:

```csharp
public static void ConfigurePlatformOptions(this WebApplication webApplication)
{
    webApplication.ConfigurePlatformOptions(TgxPlatform.PlatformName, BuildDefaultPlatformOptions());
}
```

The `BuildDefaultPlatformOptions` method defines the default configuration for the Connector:

```csharp
public static PlatformOptions BuildDefaultPlatformOptions()
{
    return new PlatformOptions
    {
        Search = new SearchOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
        },
        Quote = new QuoteOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
            SearchRequired = new SearchRequired
            {
                When = SearchRequiredWhen.Always
            }
        },
        Book = new BookOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
            QuoteRequired = new QuoteRequired
            {
                When = QuoteRequiredWhen.Never
            }
        },
        CheckBookings = new CheckBookingsOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
        },
        Cancel = new CancelOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default
        }
    };
}
```

## **Usage Notes**

- The `PlatformOptions` must be defined for each Connector and tailored to the supplierâ€™s specific requirements.
- Validating these configurations during development ensures seamless operation and prevents runtime errors.
- The flexibility provided by `PlatformOptions` allows for scalability and adaptability to new supplier requirements.
