# About Us

## What Is Travelgate And How Can It Help Me?

Travelgate is a **Connectivity Marketplace** that connects Buyers and Sellers of travel products. Our advanced technology has earned the trust of major industry players and specialized providers worldwide.

Gone are the days when travel agencies and websites had to manage multiple API integrations to access different Sellers' products. With Travelgate, a single API integration provides instant access to a vast array of travel opportunities, ensuring fast and seamless connections with an unbeatable time-to-market.

For Buyers, integrating with our API provides a standardized data feed from all Sellers. No more juggling multiple integrations—adding a new Seller is as simple as signing a contract, with no additional integration work required.

For Sellers, Travelgate offers an expansive distribution network. Whether you're a Tour Operator, OTA, Bedbank, or DMC, our platform allows you to sell your products and cross-sell to a diverse pool of potential customers. The possibilities in our dynamic Marketplace are endless.
