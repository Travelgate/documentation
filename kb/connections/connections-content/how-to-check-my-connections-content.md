## How can I use the "Force update now" functionality?🚀
In order to force an update of your static content, you should simply follow the steps below:

1. Access "My Connections Content" section (follow the steps above) and filter by access/Seller credentials.

1. Filter a specific connection and access, ensuring you are browsing as a Seller or Buyer as needed. There, you will also see the total number of hotels and last update information.

2. Click on **'Force update now',** and our system will immediately run a content update. Note that the duration may vary based on the size of the content and the time it takes for our system to process the requested update. See the callout below for more information.

:::info Force Content Updates
When conducting a 'Force content now' update to refresh a Seller's portfolio, note that the duration of the update depends on the **size of the content**. The update is managed through a **queue system** and will proceed when it reaches its turn (this could take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, or potentially even a day). If the update has not completed after this time, you may initiate the force update again if necessary.

Besides, keep in mind that if you force an update for a large set of accesses, such as updating all accesses for a Supplier across all Buyers, will result in a longer queue, thereby increasing the overall update duration.

In cases where you've followed the steps above and still do not have the most up-to-date content, please don't hesitate to reach out through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team) for further help. We're here to ensure you have the best possible experience!
