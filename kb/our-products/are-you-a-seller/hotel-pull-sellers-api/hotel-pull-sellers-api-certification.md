# Hotel Pull Sellers Generic API Certification

:::danger deprecated API
The Legacy Pull Sellers API was our first Sellers API, launched back in 2012. It is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Since then, we have launched a new Pull Sellers API, in which Travelgate currently plays a proactive role in [developing API integrations](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-seller/getting-started-as-a-new-seller/seller-api-development-roadmap) on behalf of the Seller.
:::

Ensuring that our Partners fully understand our API, can make good use of it and that the information transmitted is correct is essential for a successful collaboration. That's why all the Partners connecting to our Platform are required to pass a certification process, whether they are buying or selling in our Marketplace.

### When should I apply for certification?✔️
You should apply once you've finished the Hotel Pull Sellers Generic API development.

### How is it the certification structured?💡
The certification for the Hotel Pull Sellers Generic API is divided into three main blocks:

1. Static content
1. Booking Flow 
1. Booking Management

### What information do I need to provide?💡
