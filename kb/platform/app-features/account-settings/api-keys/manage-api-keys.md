# How to Manage API Keys

## What is an API Key?

An **API key** is a unique alphanumeric identifier used to authenticate requests to Travelgate’s APIs, such as the **Hotel-X Pull Buyers API**. The API key must be included in the **HTTP Authorization** header to verify the requestor’s identity and authenticate the user agent with the server.

In the **API Keys** section, you can manage and view the API keys configured for your Organization, including details such as their creation dates and the ability to generate new ones.

To manage your Organization’s API keys, follow these simple steps:

1. **Log into Travelgate**: Start by logging into your [Travelgate account](https://www.travelgate.com/).

2. **Navigate to API Keys**: Click on your user profile and go to the "API Keys" section to view your API keys.

## What Can I Find in My API Keys Section?

Here’s what you can find in the **API Keys** section:

- **View API Key List**: Check the list of API keys associated with your Organization.
- **API Key Details**: For each key, you’ll see the name, creation date, and the last few characters of the key. For security reasons, the full API key cannot be retrieved after creation. If you’ve lost access to your API key, you will need to generate a new one.
