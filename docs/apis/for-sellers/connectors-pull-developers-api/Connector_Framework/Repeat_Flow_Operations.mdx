# Repeat Flow Operations

**Repeat Flow Operations** are additional calls required within a workflow to ensure validity or re-authentication. These operations typically occur when a previous step in the flow requires verification or when a supplier's session token expires.

---

## **Common Scenarios**
- **From Quote to Search**: A second search is triggered to validate the option in a `Quote`.
- **From Book to Quote**: Ensures the option is still valid and the price hasn’t changed before booking.
- **From Cancel to CheckBookings**: Verifies the booking status before attempting a cancellation.

---

## **Configuration**
Repeat Flow Operations are configured in the **PlatformOptions**. [View PlatformOptions](../Advanced_Configuration/PlatformOptions.mdx)

Example configuration:
```csharp
public static PlatformOptions BuildDefaultPlatformOptions()
{
    return new PlatformOptions
    {
        Search = new SearchOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
        },
        Quote = new QuoteOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
            SearchRequired = new SearchRequired
            {
                When = SearchRequiredWhen.Always
            }
        },
        Book = new BookOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
            QuoteRequired = new QuoteRequired
            {
                When = QuoteRequiredWhen.Never
            }
        },
        CheckBookings = new CheckBookingsOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
        },
        Cancel = new CancelOptions
        {
            ConnectorsHttpClient = ConnectorsHttpClient.Default,
            CheckBookingsByReferenceRequired = new CheckBookingsByReferenceRequired
            {
                When = CheckBookingsByReferenceRequiredWhen.Always
            }
        }
    };
}
```

## **Quote Triggering a Search**
A `Quote` operation might require a `Search` operation in the following cases:
- **Suppliers Without a Dedicated Quote Operation**: Some suppliers ensure that the price and cancellation policies in the `Search` response will not change. In such cases, a second `Search` replaces the `Quote`.
- **Suppliers Using Session Tokens**: If the token provided during the `Search` has expired by the time of the `Quote`, a second `Search` ensures the session is valid.

To configure this, include the following in the **Extensions** for `Quote`:

```csharp
services.AddDefaultQuoteOnlySearchOperation<SearchResponse, CntAccessModel>(
    TgxPlatform.PlatformName,
    configuration);
```

If customization of the `ParseResponse` logic is required, use:

```csharp
services.AddQuoteOnlySearchOperation<SearchResponse, CntAccessModel>(
    TgxPlatform.PlatformName,
    configuration);
```

This requires implementing the `IQuoteOnlySearchOperation` interface, which includes:
- **ParseResponse**: Custom response handling.
- **TryValidateModelRequest**: Validates the model request.
- **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Validates supplier responses.

### **Handling Mutable Parameters**
In some cases, parameters passed during the first `Search` might change in subsequent operations. For instance, a supplier’s session token might expire, requiring it to be refreshed in the second `Search`.

To handle such cases, set `immutable` to `false` when building parameters. This ensures they can be dynamically updated.

Example:
```csharp
Parameter.BuildParameter(
    OptionParameters.RoomId,
    room.IdHabitacion,
    ParameterType.Supplier,
    immutable: false,
    occupancyRefId
);
```

## **Business Logic and Error Management**
Repeat operations follow **Travelgate's business standards**, ensuring:
- **Validation**: Matching input parameters, room details, and descriptive elements.
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors like `ItemNotAvailable` during the second `Search`. [View Error Handling in Connectors](Error_Handling_in_Connectors.mdx)

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Repeat Flow Operations enhance reliability and ensure compliance with supplier requirements.
- They are easily configurable via **PlatformOptions** and can be customized using specialized service extensions.
- Errors and business logic are automatically handled to align with Travelgate standards.
