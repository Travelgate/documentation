:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Reservation

The Reservation operation requests a booking confirmation for a specific list of passengers. It provides 
the booking locator (booking code), which could be the supplierâ€™s own code or the one sent in request, along with all the charges associated with the booking as well as its status. The returned fields include: `ProviderLocator`, `PropertyReservationNumber`, `ResStatus`, `Price` etc.

:::caution

The amount of information returned might vary between Sellers.

## Reservation Response

After each request, the Seller will process the data and provide you with a response. Upon receiving a `Reservation` request, the Seller will send you a corresponding `Reservation` response. 

The response options include either **success** or an **error**. If successful, it will indicate that the reservation has been completed successfully.

:::caution

Be aware that you might receive an error and a reservation status 'OK' in the same response. In such cases, you should always verify the reservation status using a reservation read or by checking directly with the supplier.

:::


### Success

```xml
<ReservationRS>
   <ProviderLocator>102</ProviderLocator>
   <PropertyReservationNumber>HCN8273</PropertyReservationNumber>
   <ResStatus>OK</ResStatus>
   <Price currency = "EUR" amount = "36.20" binding = "false" commission = "-1" minimumSellingPrice="-1"/>
</ReservationRS>
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>In what cases might there be a price difference between Reservation and Valuation methods?</summary>

<p>We cannot guarantee that the price will be returned in Reservation, given that this is something which depends on the supplier, and unless they provide us the price in their response, there is no way for us to return it to you.</p>
<p>If the price returned in Reservation method is different than the one returned in the Valuation method, 4 cases could occur. Below, we have explained each of these cases and what should be done if either of them occur:</p>

<b>Case 1</b>

<p>The price in Reservation is lower than the price in Valuation. The selling price for the final customer will be the one in valuation, as this is the one that will be accepted by them at the time of booking.</p>

<b>Case 2</b>

<p>The price in Reservation is higher than the price in valuation:</p>

<b>Case 2.1</b>

<p>The supplier allows DeltaPrice and you allow a price change of, for example, up to â‚¬10, indicating it in through our DeltaPrice field (explained in the previous section):</p>

<p>Valuation:</p>

```xml
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "110" binding = "false" commission = "0"/>
```

<p>Reservation:</p>

```xml
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "110" binding = "false" commission = "0"/>
```

<p>When making reservation, you must pay the supplier â‚¬110, given that you have decided not to lose the booking even though the price has increased with â‚¬10 compared to Valuation.</p>

<b>Case 2.2</b>

<p>The supplier allows DeltaPrice and you DO NOT allow price change. In this case we will return an error, as you do not permit a higher reservation price than the one already established in Valuation.</p>

<b>Case 2.3</b>

<p>The supplier DOES NOT allow DeltaPrice. If the supplier returns a higher price in Reservation than he does in Valuation, then the difference should be reported, as you have not specified in any way that the price can be changed. In this case the supplier has to cover the price change.</p>
