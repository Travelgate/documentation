# User Management

## User Roles

User roles in the **Inventory Extranet** define what actions a user can perform and which sections they can access. You can configure user roles through the **Manage** section, allowing **Clients** to create, modify, or remove accounts for both their team and hoteliers.

### Available User Roles

1. **Client** – Can view and modify all hotel information assigned to them, regardless of the **Provider (Channel Manager)**.
2. **Client Admin** – Has full access to all client-related data, including hotels and Channel Managers. Unlike the Client role, Admins do not need hotel-specific permissions and can create or delete users.
3. **Client Viewer** – Can view all information but **cannot** make modifications. Has access to the **Availability, Calendar, Booking List, and Booking Price Details** tabs under the **Product** section.
4. **Provider** – Can view, upload, and modify information related to their assigned hotels. Unlike Client users, Providers have access only to Channel Managers they are linked to and can manage settings under **Inventory and Product** sections.
5. **Provider Viewer** – Can view all information but **cannot** modify it. Has access to the **Availability, Calendar, Booking List, and Booking Price Details** tabs under the **Product** section. This role is commonly assigned to **hoteliers**.

## Configuring User Roles

1. **Log in** to the **Inventory Extranet** and go to the **Manage** section in the top menu.

:::info
If a **hotelier** requests access to the **Extranet**, it is the **Client's** responsibility to create the user and assign appropriate permissions (role). Travelgate does not manage hotelier user creation. Typically, hoteliers are assigned **Provider** or **Provider Viewer** roles with access limited to their hotel.
