# VALIDATION_ERROR

### What does a "VALIDATION_ERROR" mean?💡
A "VALIDATION_ERROR" occurs when the validation information provided in your Hotel-X request does not match the information set for your account or is not valid for that specific request.

### What can I do if I receive a "VALIDATION_ERROR" in my response?🔎
Since this error serves as an indication that there is a discrepancy or issue with the validation process, you should check the following information:

- **Verify access**: You should check [My Connections](/kb/connections/my-connections/) in order to make sure that the access/es set in your request have already been configured for your account (status "working") and are active:
    - If your access displays a "not working" status: One or more processes in the activation have failed and our connectivity team needs to review it manually. You can [contact](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) our Activations Team if necessary via the [Auto-Activations Case](/kb/tickets/travelgatex-tickets).
    - If your access is not active: Please make sure you activate it in order to run requests via our Platform.
- Access type **Test/Live**: Verify that the "testMode" tag in your request matches the Test/Live settings for that specific access.
- **Verify Client**: the Client set in your request should be one of those configured for your account. More information on Hotel-X Clients can be found [here](/kb/connections/connections-settings/).
- **Verify Apikey**: the Apikey set in your request should be the one configured for your account. You will find more information on your API Settings [here](/kb/connections/connections-settings).
- **Verify Context**: the Context code set in your request should match the mapping expected in your request:
    - [Single Mode request](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/booking-flow/search/hotel-x-single-mode-and-multimode-search): you may either request with the Supplier context (you can check this information in [My Connections](/kb/connections/my-connections/), at an access level) or with your own Client context (Mapping uploaded to the SFTP).
    - [Multi-mode request](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/booking-flow/search/hotel-x-single-mode-and-multimode-search): you should use your own Client context.
- **Verify criteria**: you should check the criteria in your request is valid. For example, do not set check-in and check-out dates from the past.
