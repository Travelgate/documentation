# How to Copy an Access

To **speed up the process of copying a pre-existing access** and reduce the risk of typographical errors when filling out the access form, we've enabled the "Copy Access" feature in the [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections) section.

Follow these steps to copy an access:

1. **Select Connection**: Go to [My Connections](/kb/web-features/connections/my-connections/managing-connections/connections-details), filter the access you want to copy, click on “Actions,” and then select **Copy Access**.
2. **Complete the "Copy Access" Form**: The form will be pre-filled with information from the copied access. However, some fields require you to review and update them:
   - **Access Name**: The name is pre-filled with the original access name, plus the prefix `COPY_` to differentiate it. Choose a distinctive name for the new access.
   - **Notification Emails**: Add your email(s) to receive notifications about the activation process.
   - **Credentials**: Set the appropriate credentials for the connection. Be sure to review all fields and make any necessary edits before requesting activation.
3. **Activation Process**: The activation process for the copied access is similar to any other activation and may take some time. For more information, check out our [Auto-Activations Guide](/kb/web-features/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).
