## What Information Can I Find in My Connections?  

In the [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections) section, you will find a list of all your connections and their respective access details.  

### **Filtering Your Connections**  
You can filter your connections using the following parameters:  

- **Access Status**:  
  - **Working**: The access is active and fully operational.  
  - **In Progress**: The automatic activation process is ongoing. If an issue arises, Travelgate's team will manually intervene.  
  - **Pending Seller's Feedback**: The access is in a validation phase, awaiting additional details from the Buyer or Seller.  

- **Access Type**:  
  - **Live**: Access using production credentials.  
  - **Test**: Access using test credentials.  

:::warning Access Type Information  
The access type (live or test) is based on the credentials agreed upon by the Buyer and Seller. Both parties must ensure consensus on this, as the access type is **editable per access**.  
:::  

- **Access Active Status**:  
  - **Yes**: The access is active and operational.  
  - **No**: The access is inactive, meaning no further Hotel-X requests will be processed. **Note**: Deactivating an access may take time to fully propagate through the system.
