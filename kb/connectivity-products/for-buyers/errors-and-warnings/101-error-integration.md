# 101 Error - System Exception

## What Does a 101 Error Mean? 
A **101 error** (system exception) occurs when Travelgate does not receive a required tag or field while parsing the supplier’s response. This error can also appear if the Buyer omits necessary fields in their request.

## How to Resolve a 101 Error 
1. **Check Required Fields** – If you’re a Buyer, make sure your request includes all mandatory fields for the specific operation. If you’re a Seller, ensure your response contains all fields expected by Travelgate through the integration.
2. **Contact Support** – If you're unsure which fields are missing or how to correct the issue, reach out to Travelgate support for assistance.
