## **Overview**

The `CheckBookings By Reference` operation allows clients to retrieve the status of a specific booking using locators provided by both the client and the supplier. This operation is crucial for post-booking management and provides insights into the reservation status, any changes, or additional information supplied by the provider.

## **Purpose**

- **Supplementary Information**: Optionally returns additional details depending on the supplier's capabilities, such as:
  - Room details.
  - Payment status.
  - Guest details.
- **Error Management**: Helps identify issues with the booking using standardized error codes.

## **When to Use**

- **After Booking Confirmation**: To verify the booking status and details.
