# Error code 0 - Price not found for standard occupancy

### What does a 0 error code mean?💡
"Price not found for standard occupancy (n Adults)" errors are returned whenever attempting to load prices per standard occupancy without setting the price for the number of adults in the standard occupancy.

The error message will provide guidance on the mandatory requirement of specifying the number of adults for the standard occupancy.
### What can I do if I receive a Error code 0 - Price not found for standard occupancy error in my response?✔️
For example:

```
<Error Type="1" ShortText="Price not found for standard occupancy ( 1 Adults)." Code="0">Price not found for standard occupancy ( 1 Adults).</Error>
```

In the avove scenario, the standard occupancy is set to **1 adult** so in order to resolve the issue you should simply update the information by loading prices for 1 adult and resend your request.
