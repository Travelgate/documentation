This guide should help you efficiently access and manage the necessary files for using the CSV API. Happy working!

### 2. Enhanced Spreadsheet Features
	The spreadsheets you are using have been equipped with custom scripts designed to perform several functions, such as data validation, mandatory field checks, and exporting to a specific CSV format. These enhancements help ensure data consistency and ease the data handling process.

#### 1. Data Validation Scripts
   
Mandatory Fields: As you fill out the spreadsheet, scripts automatically check whether all required fields have been completed. If a mandatory field is missing, a prompt will appear, indicating which data is required in that particular row.
Format Validation: If data entered into a field with a specified format is incorrect, a message will be sent explaining the required format, often accompanied by an example. This ensures that all data adheres to expected standards before processing or exporting.

#### 2. Export Functionality
   
CSV Export with Custom Separator: A new function has been added to allow exporting the spreadsheet data as a CSV file using a semicolon (;) as a delimiter. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining compatibility with systems that require this specific CSV format.

#### 3. Interactive Column Descriptions
   
Guidance on Data Entry: To understand what type of information should be entered in each column, simply hover your cursor over the header row of each column. A tooltip will appear providing a brief description of the data expected in that column. This feature serves as an in-built guide to aid in correct data entry.

How to Use These Features
#### Completing the Spreadsheet
Fill out each cell carefully, adhering to the instructions and format guidelines provided.
Pay attention to prompts and error messages.
These are designed to help you correct entries before proceeding.

#### Exporting Data
Locate the export button or option within the spreadsheet tools.
Choose the CSV export option, ensuring that the semicolon (;) delimiter is selected or set.
Save or download the file to your desired location.

Tips for Effective Use
Regularly save your progress to avoid data loss.
Familiarize yourself with the format requirements and tooltips before beginning intensive data entry.
If repeated errors occur, review the data formats and requirements in the tooltips or documentation to ensure understanding.

These tools and features are designed to streamline your workflow and enhance data accuracy. By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage and prepare your data using the enhanced capabilities of the speadsheet.

### 3. File Naming Importance for Travelgate FTP Uploads

Understanding the significance of file naming is crucial for successful file uploads to Travelgate's FTP. Below is a summary of the required elements to correctly name your file, which are detailed through examples shared in the file schema:

#### clientCode(Inventory):  
This is Travelgate's native code for the client in the inventory system.
:::note

Your ClientCode can be retrieved from any Travelgate's access with a Channel Manager.
See [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections) and click "Get form data" in the selected access, the code in Password is equivalent to the ClientCode.

:::
#### providerCode(Inventory):  
This is Travelgate's native code for the provider in the inventory.
:::note

Your ProviderCode can be retrieved from any Travelgate's access with a Channel Manager.
See [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections) and click "Get form data" in the selected access, the code in User is equivalent to the ProviderCode.

:::

#### HotelCode#ContextCode:  
Depending on the type of connection to a Channel Manager, there are two scenarios to consider for naming your file: 

* **Scenario 1:** Connecting to a Channel Manager Using Its Own Codes:

	* **HotelCode**: Use the native code provided by the Channel Manager.
	* **ContextCode**: This part must be filled in, as it is essential for the Channel Manager that uses its own unique codes. It is mandatory to include both the hotel code and the context code in the file name.

* **Scenario 2:** Connecting to a Channel Manager Using Travelgate Inventory Codes:

	* **HotelCode**: Use the code from Travelgate's inventory.   
	To check if the hotel exists in inventory you can retrieve current details using the following queries: [Hotels Master](../inventory-set-up-graphql-api/masters/hotels-master/), [Search Hotels Master](../inventory-set-up-graphql-api/masters/hotels-master/search-hotels-master)
	* **ContextCode**: This part should be ignored as the Channel Manager works with Travelgate's inventory codes, and no additional contextual code is needed.

**Examples:**  
* **Example for Scenario 1:**
Example:
Imagine you are the client "travelClient (TGX)" connected to the channel manager "travelgateChannelManagerNativeCode (TGXCMNC)", which uses natives hotel codes (Native1234). If you are completing the "rooms" file, the download file name should be: clientCode(Inventory)-providerCode(Inventory)-HotelCode#ContextCode-rooms.csv. In this Case, you would name the file "TGX-TGXCMNC-Native1234#TRV-rooms.csv". The ContextCode can be found in the same sheet, in the column "context", you have a dropdown with the current values of the channels managers that work with native hotel codes.

* **Example for Scenario 2:**
Imagine you are the client "travelClient (TGX)" connected to the channel manager "travelgateChannelManager (TGXCM)", which uses hotel codes from the inventory. If you are completing the "rooms" file, the download file name should be: "clientCode(Inventory)-providerCode(Inventory)-HotelCode#ContextCode-rooms.csv. In this case, you would name the file "TGX-TRVCM-1234-rooms.csv", omitting the #ContextCode since the connected channel does not use native codes but relies on Travelgate's inventory codes.

### 4. Uploading Files to SFTP and Configuration 

After completing the necessary preliminary steps, the next stage involves uploading your files to the SFTP server. 

When accessing the SFTP, you will find three folders in the main directory, each referring to different Travelgate services that can use the SFTP for mappings, setups, etc. In this case, we focus on the Inventory section, where you should upload the CSV files needed for setup.

:::caution
**IMPORTANT**: It is essential to use the correct file naming conventions to ensure the files can be processed via the SFTP.
:::
#### File Checking Frequency
It is important to note that our CSV API checks the SFTP server every 10 seconds for new files. This frequent scanning ensures that any files you upload are quickly detected and processed, minimizing delay in data handling.

This guide will ensure you can securely transfer your files to the appropriate destination without any issues.
