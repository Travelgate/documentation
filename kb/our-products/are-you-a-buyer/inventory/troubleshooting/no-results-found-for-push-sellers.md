### What are the typical causes of a "no availability" error for Push Sellers?🔎
Here are the possible causes for availability not being displayed for Push Sellers in our Extranet, along with the corresponding solutions:
1. **Deactivated hotel/rates/rooms:** Check the SetUp section and ensure that the hotel/rates/rooms are not deactivated. They will be highlighted in red if they are.

2. **No product loaded for requested rates/rooms/occupancies:** If no product is loaded, availability results will not be obtained.
3. **Ensure Room Setup Matches Desired Occupancies:** Remember to verify that the [rooms](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup#room)  are configured in the setup for all the occupancies you want them to be available for.
4. **Close Sales, Close On Arrival, or Close On Departure enabled for requested dates:** Days with Close Sales will be highlighted in red, while days with sales Closed On Arrival and/or Closed On Departure will be highlighted in a different shade of green and a checkbutton will be also applied.
