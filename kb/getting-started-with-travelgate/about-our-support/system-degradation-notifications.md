# System Degradation Notifications


### What is TravelgateX Status Page?‚ö†Ô∏è

[Travelgatex Status Page](https://app.travelgate.com/status) provides **real-time information** on the status of various TravelgateX services, including our Hotel-X API, Hotel Push and Hotel Pull APIs, TravelgateX website, and other services like Distribution or other Applications.

It allows you to check the real-time status of our API, including any outages, service degradations, and updates. To stay updated, we recommend **subscribing** to our status notification service, which will send you an email notification in case of any service disruption.

If there is a service degradation, there is no need to submit a Case with our Customer Support team as our IT team will already be working to identify and resolve the issue.

### What should you do if you are experiencing a service degradation but there are no reported issues on our Status service?üí°
1. Firstly, we recommend examining the **performance of all your connectivities**, as it is possible that one of your Sellers might be encountering issues within their own system.
1. If the problem persists even after checking the above information, please don't hesitate to contact our [Customer Support team](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for further assistance.
