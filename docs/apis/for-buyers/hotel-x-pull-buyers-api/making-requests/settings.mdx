# Hotel-X API Settings

In all booking flow and booking management requests, you'll find certain fields that you need to fill in. These include the `HotelSettingsInput` and `criteria` inputs. These fields contain various elements, some of which are known as `settings`. These settings are the common configurations used to construct your requests to the supplier/s. They consist of fields that are frequently needed, like `language`, `currency`, and `timeout`.

You have the flexibility to fill in these settings with different values for each of your `query` and `mutation` requests. However, to make things easier, you can also choose not to fill them in every time, especially if you know the values will remain the same. In such cases, we have default settings. These default settings are the values we'll use in the background if you don't specify the fields that are part of these settings.

:::info Remember!

When you begin using Travelgate, these settings are automatically created, but it's essential to review and update them according to your preferences in our [API Settings](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/api-settings) website section.

## Settings fields

We'll clarify which fields are categorized as `settings` and where you can locate them. We'll also specify whether it's mandatory to provide a value for each field or if you have the option to leave it empty, in which case the default settings will be applied:

| Field                  | Mandatory / Optional | Where to Fill It                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `client`               | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input)                                  |
| `context`              | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `timeout`              | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `businessRules`        | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `language`             | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `currency`             | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `nationality`          | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `markets`              | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `optionsQuota`         | Optional             | Query (Criteria input), default settings or 300 will be used as value. This sets the maximum number of options returned per board in a search. If not specified in the query, the system will use the value from your Hotel-X API default settings. If no value is set there, the system will default to 300 options. |


## Default API settings levels in Hotel-X

Default API settings are configurations that Travelgate uses **behind the scenes** when creating requests to Suppliers on behalf of Buyers, but only if those settings haven’t been explicitly defined in the Buyer’s query or mutation.

These defaults ensure the system behaves as expected even when some parameters aren’t included in the requests. You can configure all of these default settings in our web platform under **Connections → [API Settings](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/settings)**.

These settings can be defined at various levels, each with a different scope and level of specificity:

1. **Organization/Group Level**  
   These settings apply to your entire organization or Hotel-X group. Useful when you want a consistent baseline across all your connections.

   > Hotel-X groups refer to a group of clients to which you can apply different business rules. By default, as a Buyer, you only have one Hotel-X group. You don’t need to worry about having more than one unless you have very specific business needs. If you do, please contact our Customer Care team.


2. **Client Level**  
   These settings apply to an individual client.  
   - They override organization-level settings.
   - You can configure these in the “Clients Settings” tab.

3. **Supplier Level**  
   These apply to all accesses associated with a particular supplier.  
   - They override client and organization-level settings.
   - Configurable in the “Supplier Settings” tab.

4. **Access Level**  
   These settings apply to a specific access (connection between a client and a supplier).  
   - They override organization, client, and supplier settings.
   - Configurable in the Access Settings” tab.

:::info Remember!

Settings defined at query or mutation level (in your API request) take **absolute precedence** over any default settings at any other level.

Query/Mutation > Access > Supplier > Client > Organization
