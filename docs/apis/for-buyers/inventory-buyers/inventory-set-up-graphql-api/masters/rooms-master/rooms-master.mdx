# Rooms Master

## Query Overview

The `roomsMaster` query returns a list of all the hotel room masters created in Inventory. The returned fields include:

* `id`
* `code`
* `name`

### 1. Criteria

This query offers versatility, with an optional field `codes` that can be filled with the Room masters' codes to retrieve. This allows for a tailored query, ensuring that only relevant data is retrieved.

#### Mandatory Input
* `clientCode`

#### Optional Input
* `codes`

:::note
Your `ClientCode` can be retrieved from any Travelgate access with a Channel Manager.  
See [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections) and click "Get form data" in the selected access. The code in `Password` is equivalent to the `ClientCode`.

### 2. Settings

To retrieve room masters, provide the `clientCode` and, optionally, specify `codes` to filter by specific room types.
