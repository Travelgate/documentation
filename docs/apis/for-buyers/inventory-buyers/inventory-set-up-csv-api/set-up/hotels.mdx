# Hotels

The Hotels file is designed to facilitate the setup of hotels within the Inventory platform. It's necessary for managing hotel-specific data and relate to the appropriate channel manager.

### Hotel Search in Inventory
:::note
**Attention**  
Before setting up new hotels, ensure that the hotel does not already exist in the inventory. To verify the existence of the hotel code, you should launch a query in the inventory. If the hotel exists, you should copy the code to add it to the .csv file.

Note that the hotel master is shared for all inventory customers, all hotels created are shared between customers.

To view existing hotel data, clients can retrieve the current details using the following queries: [Inventory Hotel Search](/docs/apis/for-buyers/inventory-buyers/inventory-set-up-graphql-api/masters/hotels-master/search-hotels-master)
