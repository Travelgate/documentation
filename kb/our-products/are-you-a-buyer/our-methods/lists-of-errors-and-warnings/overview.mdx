# List of errors and warnings

Welcome to this section where we'll provide you with a comprehensive list of errors and warnings that users may come across while using our Hotel Buyers API. These errors and warnings can be received in responses during the booking flow, management, and content methods.  

We strongly recommend incorporating the errors and warnings fields into your Hotel-X Queries and Mutations. This will enable you to quickly identify potential issues and take necessary actions based on the errors or warnings you receive. For more details, please refer to our [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API Documentation](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) and [GraphQL API Reference](/api).

**Let's dive right in!**
