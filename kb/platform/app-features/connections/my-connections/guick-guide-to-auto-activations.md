# Quick Guide to Auto-Connections

This guide will walk you through the process of requesting a connection with one of our Partners via the Travelgate Marketplace. We aim to make this process as straightforward and seamless as possible, helping you connect with Partners and enhance your business opportunities.

Our goal has always been to make connecting with a Partner easier and faster.

:::info Keep in mind:
- **Having a commercial contract with Travelgate** is essential to request a new connection.
- **Activations of connections with Channel Managers via Travelgate** should always be requested by the Buyers, not the Channel Managers themselves.

## How Can I Request a New Connection?

1. **Log into** [our Platform](https://www.travelgate.com/).

2. **Navigate to "Connections" > "My Connections"**. Ensure you're logged into the correct Organization and Partner profile (Buyer or Seller). You can find this information in the top right corner of your screen.

3. **Click "Create a New Connection"** to begin the process.
    - **Step 1 (Partner)**: Select the Partner you want to connect with. Some Sellers may offer multiple connection types ([Pull or Push](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/connectivity-services/pull-and-push-connectivity)), so choose the one that fits your needs.

    - **Step 2 (Access Configuration)**: Assign a distinctive name for your access (e.g., B2B or B2C). Indicate whether it’s for testing or live use. Then, complete the form with the credentials provided by the Seller.

        :::info
        Depending on their system specifications, **each Seller may have different access credentials requirements**. For example, some may need specific fields, while others require designated URL endpoints for methods such as search, quote, book, or others. This information should always be provided and confirmed by each Seller.  
        
        Make sure your credentials are active and fully functional before proceeding, as using inactive credentials can cause delays.
        :::

    - **Step 3 (Notification Setup)**: Provide one or more contact email addresses for the Partner you are connecting with, so they can be notified once the connection is created and ready for use. **The Partner contact email must be registered in Travelgate**. You can also use the 'Other Contacts' field to add additional email addresses—such as colleagues or relevant team members—who should receive the notifications.

        :::warning Notification Setup Error
        If the Partner (Buyer or Seller) contact entered in the Notification Setup screen is **not registered under Settings > Users & Contacts Management** in the Travelgate Portal, you will receive the following error: _"The email [Partner email] does not exist in [Partner Organization]. Please use an email that is registered in [Partner Organization]."_

        To resolve this issue, contact your Partner and **ask them to either:**
        - Provide a contact email that is already registered in their [Users & Contacts Management section](/kb/platform/app-features/account-settings/users-management/add-users), or
        - Add the relevant email address to that section.

    - **Step 4 (Review and Confirm)**: Double-check your information before starting the auto-activation process. If you and your Partner have a Commercial Agreement for 2023, the form will show available payment types:
        - **FREE**: No cost to you. Your Partner will cover the connectivity fee.
        - **STD**: Standard booking fees apply for both you and your Partner.
        - **SUP**: Both standard fees and supplements apply to you, but it's free for your Partner.

4. **Once completed**, you’ll receive an email with all the information needed to activate the connection. You can also track the activation status in the "My Connections" section.
Please note that **all accesses are delivered inactive**, and it is the Partners’ responsibility to activate them (both Buyers and Sellers should be aligned to carry out the activation).


        :::tip I haven’t received the confirmation email for the credentials I requested. What should I do?  
        If you haven’t received the confirmation email, follow these steps:
        1. **Check Activation Status**: Verify the status of the activation ticket and ensure the requested credential is marked as 'active' in the 'My Connections' section.
        2. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**: Sometimes, confirmation emails end up in your spam folder.
        3. **Review Email Settings**: If the email isn't in your spam folder, there may be an issue with your email notification settings.
        4. **Contact Support**: If you still haven't received the email, contact Travelgate Support for assistance.

## Auto-Connection Status

Once you’ve requested a new connection, you can track its progress in the "My Connections" section. Here's what each status means:

| Status                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Working**             | Your access is ready and working! Please wait for the email from our activations team confirming that your credentials are ready before opening your feed. |
| 🟡 **In Progress**         | The automatic setup is still in process, but it will be ready soon. If there’s an issue, our team will intervene and update you. |
| 🔵 **Partner's feedback required** | We’re waiting for additional details from either the Seller or Buyer to proceed. |

:::info
If you have any updates regarding activation or additional details, please avoid submitting new support cases. Instead, **respond to the email thread with the Connectivity Team** for more efficient communication.
