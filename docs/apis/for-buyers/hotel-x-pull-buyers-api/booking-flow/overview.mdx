# Overview

In order to book a hotel room, booking flow methods must be executed sequentially: `search`, `quote` and `book`.

These methods must be executed sequentially:

- **Search**: The starting point of the flow. Here you request availability based on specific criteria such as hotel code, dates, and number of guests. The response returns a list of **options** — rates provided by different Suppliers — including details like price, board, room type, and policies.

- **Quote**: Once you’ve selected an option from the Search response, this step allows you to **revalidate** it. The Quote call confirms the most up-to-date price, policies, and availability for the chosen option before proceeding to booking.

- **Book**: The final step of the flow. This call **confirms the reservation** with the Supplier and returns the booking details and confirmation information.
