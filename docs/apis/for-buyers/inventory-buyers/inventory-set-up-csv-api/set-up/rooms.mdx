# Rooms

The Rooms file is designed to facilitate the setup of rooms within the Inventory platform. It's necessary for managing room-specific data and relate to the appropriate channel manager.

### Room Search in Inventory
:::note
**Attention**  
Before setting up new rooms, ensure that the room does not already exist in the inventory. To verify the existence of the room code, you should launch a query in the inventory. If the room exists, you should use the existing code when adding it to the .csv file.

Please note that the room master is unique for each customer, if you start working with us, we recommend to start by creating the room master before setting up the rooms
:::
To check if a room already exists, clients can retrieve the current details using the following query: [Inventory Room Search](/docs/apis/for-buyers/inventory-buyers/inventory-set-up-graphql-api/masters/rooms-master)

### File Name Format

The file name format for the Room Setup is as follows: **clientCode-providerCode-HotelCode#ContextCode-rooms.csv**.
