# How to Add an Access for an Existing Connection

If you already have a connection with one of our Partners and need to **add additional credentials (new accesses)**, you can do this directly at the connection level in "My Connections."

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the "My Connections" section and filter for the desired connection.
2. Click the blue **Add New Access** button next to the selected access.
3. Complete the [connection form](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) to add the new credentials for that Partner.
4. That's it! You’ve successfully requested activation for the new access. Easy, right?
