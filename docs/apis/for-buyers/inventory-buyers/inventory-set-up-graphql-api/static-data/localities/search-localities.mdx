# Search Localities

## Query Overview

The `searchLocalities` query allows you to search for localities created in Inventory based on their names. The returned fields include:

* `id`
* `name`
* `countryCode`
* `unLocode`

### 1. Criteria

When building your query, you need to provide the following input fields:

#### Mandatory Input
* `localityName` - The name of the locality to search for.

#### Optional Input
* `countryCode` - The ISO 2-character country code to filter localities by country.

### 2. Settings

This query allows searching for localities by name and optionally filtering by country code to get more precise results.

:::note
The `countryCode` value follows the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) standard.

```js
{
  "input": {
