# Quickstart

## Introduction

Our IP Management API is a read-only tool designed to list and verify the fixed IPs Travelgate provides to Sellers and Buyers. These IPs can be used to configure firewall rules, ensuring secure and controlled access to services. 

With this API, you can quickly and effortlessly query IP ranges, associated services, and the status of each address.

If you're a developer and want to jump directly into implementation, check out our [API integration section](/docs/security/ip-management-api/api-integration).

## How It Works

* **Unified Endpoint**: Access all your infrastructure data through a single GraphQL entry point: `https://api.travelgate.com/`.

* **Explore Services & IPs**: Query full lists of services and their linked IPs, or dive into specific items using service IDs or individual IPs.

* **Real-Time IP Insights**: Instantly validate if an IP falls within a known range and see what service it’s tied to—helping you troubleshoot with confidence.

* **Flexible Filtering**: From broad overviews to granular lookups, use tailored queries to fetch only what you need, reducing payload size and boosting efficiency.

## Who can use our IP Management API?
Access to the IP API is granted to both **Buyers and Sellers** using our GraphQL integration.

## Why Use Our IP Management API?

* **Centralized Visibility**: Eliminate ambiguity by maintaining a single source for your IP address mappings and service details.

* **Boost Operational Security**: Know exactly which IPs are active and where they’re being used.

Streamline your infrastructure management with accurate and structured IP data—making your systems more resilient, reliable, and easy to operate.
