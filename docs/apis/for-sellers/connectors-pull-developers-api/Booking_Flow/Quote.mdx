## **Overview**

The `Quote` operation is a crucial step in the booking workflow, used to confirm the details of an option previously retrieved in a `Search`. Since suppliers often rely on cached data or dynamic pricing, the `Quote` operation ensures that the selected option's price and policies are up-to-date before proceeding to a booking.

The `Quote` operation serves several purposes:
- **Price Validation**: Confirms the price of the selected option to account for potential changes since the `Search` response.
- **Policy Confirmation**: Validates the cancellation policies, payment terms, and other conditions tied to the selected option.
- **Data Reliability**: Ensures that all data is accurate and aligned with the supplier’s current availability before proceeding to the `Book` operation.

:::note
Always prioritize data from `Quote` over `Search`, as `Quote` reflects the most accurate and reliable information.
:::

When to use `Quote`:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: For suppliers that update prices frequently, this step confirms current rates.
- **Session-Based Suppliers**: For suppliers with expiring sessions or tokens, `Quote` helps ensure that the data remains valid.
- **Buyer Confidence**: Provides clients with an additional layer of assurance about the selected option’s details.

Common Scenarios:
- **Price Changes**: If the supplier's price differs from the `Search` response, the `Quote` operation will provide the updated price. 
  - Example: A `PriceChanged` error code is returned if there’s a discrepancy. (See [Error Handling in Connectors](../Connector_Framework/Error_Handling_in_Connectors.mdx)).
- **Option No Longer Available**: If the selected option is no longer valid, the response may include an `ItemNotAvailable` error code.
## **Cancel Policies in Quote**

Cancellation policies provided during the **quote** step are critical for Travelgate, as they offer clear and up-to-date information about cancellation terms, deadlines, and penalties. This transparency empowers buyers to make informed decisions and helps prevent misunderstandings or unexpected charges.

The `quote` response includes key fields such as:

- Whether the option is **refundable** or not.
- A detailed list of **penalties** associated with cancellation.
- The exact **cancellation deadline**, always expressed in **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**.

By delivering this data in a consistent and precise format, Travelgate ensures that all parties involved—buyers, sellers, and final customers—have a shared understanding of the financial implications before confirming a booking.

:::important
Accurate handling of cancellation policies is essential to avoid financial discrepancies and maintain trust across the Travelgate ecosystem.
:::


### **Internal Cancellation Policy Model**

At Travelgate, we use a standardized model to represent cancellation policies, allowing us to consistently translate information coming from a wide range of suppliers. Below is a breakdown of the core components of this model.

#### **Key Elements of a Cancellation Policy**

A cancellation policy is composed of a list of penalties (`CancelPenalties`). Each penalty includes the following information:

* **`PenaltyType`**: Specifies the type of penalty applied upon cancellation. It can be a fixed amount, a number of nights, or a percentage of the total cost.
* **`Currency`**: Indicates the currency in which the penalty value is expressed.
* **`Value`**: The amount of the penalty (either a monetary value, a number of nights, or a percentage).
* **`Deadline`**: The exact UTC date and time when the penalty becomes effective. Format: `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ`, e.g., `2025-05-30T23:59:59Z`.

:::note
`Deadline` and `HoursBefore` represent the same concept—the time at which the penalty is triggered. The difference is that one is absolute (`Deadline`) and the other is relative (`HoursBefore`).

#### **Internal Model Structure in C\#**

```csharp
public class CancelPolicy
{
    protected CancelPolicy() { }

    public CancelPolicy(bool refundable, IEnumerable<CancelPenalty> cancelPenalties)
    {
        Refundable = refundable;

        if (refundable)
        {
            CancelPenalties = cancelPenalties ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cancelPenalties));
        }
    }

    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public bool Refundable { get; init; }

    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public IEnumerable<CancelPenalty> CancelPenalties { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public string CancelPolicyDescription { get; set; }
}

[DataContract]
[Serializable]
public class CancelPenalty
{
    private CancelPenalty() { }

    public CancelPenalty(uint hoursBefore, PenaltyType penaltyType, Currency currency, double value, string deadline = default)
    {
        HoursBefore = hoursBefore;
        PenaltyType = penaltyType;
        Currency = currency;
        Value = value;
        Deadline = deadline;
    }

    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public uint HoursBefore { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public PenaltyType PenaltyType { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public Currency Currency { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 4)]
    public double Value { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 5)]
    public string Deadline { get; set; }
}

public enum PenaltyType
{
    Amount,    // Fixed amount
    Nights,    // Number of nights
    Percentage // Percentage of the total booking cost
}
```


## **Request**

The Request is structured to accommodate various parameters to their Quote operation.

### **Overview**

Represents the structure of the `Quote` request, including required fields such as `optionId` and `occupancy`.
