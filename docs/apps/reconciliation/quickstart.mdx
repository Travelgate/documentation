# Quickstart

## Introduction

Experience seamless booking reconciliation with our powerful, fully integrated solution. Whether you’re already a
Travelgate partner or working with external providers, our system automatically validates and reconciles data from
Buyers and Sellers, detecting discrepancies in real-time. Minimize disputes by leveraging transparent data triangulation
that pinpoints errors the moment they arise, ensuring faster resolutions and boosted trust among all parties involved.

If you are a developer and want to quickly jump into the code, check out
our [API integration](/docs/apps/reconciliation/api-integration) section.

## How It Works

* **Effortless Data Ingestion**: Easily feed booking information into our platform via a built-in API, custom integrations
(CSV), or through Travelgate Seller booking pools.

* **Match & Verify**: Our system triangulates data between Buyers, Sellers, and Travelgate. It checks and compares
statuses, prices (amount and currency), cancellations (including penalties), and—optionally—detailed property
information like hotel name, address, and room details.

* **Automated Reconciliation**: Verified bookings are reconciled instantly, and updates are shared across all parties.
This ensures accurate records, faster dispute resolution, and far fewer billing errors.

* **Notifications & Reporting**: Any anomalies are flagged automatically. Receive web notifications or generate custom
reports so you can act promptly and maintain full control of your booking ecosystem.

## Why Use Our Reconciliation Solution?

* **Avoid Unnecessary Fees**: Minimize billing cancellations by ensuring all external changes are captured and
validated, keeping you free from costly fees.

* **Track "Ghost" Bookings**: Our reconciliation bot actively monitors reservations—even for suppliers with date-range
booking lists, ensuring no unaccounted bookings slip through the cracks.

Elevate your travel operations with a streamlined, transparent, and foolproof reconciliation process that saves you
time, prevents revenue leakage, and strengthens your partner relationships.
