# API Settings

Welcome to the **API Settings** section! Here, you'll find everything you need to manage your Hotel-X Pull Buyers API connection with ease. Let’s walk through what you can expect and how to navigate through it.

### What's Inside API Settings?

In **API Settings**, you can easily view and modify your Hotel-X Pull Buyers API account settings. Follow this simple guide to get started:

1. **Log into** [our Platform](https://www.travelgate.com/).

2. **Navigate to** "Connections" > "API Settings."

3. Explore the following areas:

    - **Organization Settings**: This is where you define the default settings at the organization level. If you don’t specify settings in your queries or mutations from the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API, these default values will be automatically applied. Check our documentation for more about [Hotel-X Settings](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/making-requests/settings).

    :::info Can I set a default setting for a specific supplier or access?
    Yes, you can configure default settings at the supplier or access level. This will apply to accesses associated with that supplier or a specific access. For assistance, contact our [Customer Support](https://app.travelgate.com/support) team.

    - **Clients Tab**: This is where you can manage your Hotel-X clients, including creating new ones. Clients act as labels or tags to organize your traffic.

        When creating a new client, it inherits all connection accesses by default. If you don’t specify any access in your Search query, all accesses will be applied:
