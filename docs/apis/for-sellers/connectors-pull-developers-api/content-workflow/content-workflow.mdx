The `Content` defines all the operations that Sellers must implement  to load their static content into our database. This includes hotels, rooms, destinations, and other reference data required to ensure our Buyers receive consistent, well-structured, and correctly mapped content from our databse.

### Required and Recommended Operations

Sellers **must implement** the following endpoints `HotelList` and `Destinations`. `HotelDetails` is mandatory if `HotelListDelta` is used. The other calls are **strongly recommended** to implement for better content coverage and integrity

> ⚠️ Incomplete content implementations may result in inconsistent data mapping or limited Buyer visibility.

### Workflow

Unlike the `Shopping flow`, which relies on real-time calls, the `Content` is designed for **scheduled retrieval of static data**. Our platform periodically calls the Seller endpoints (every 15 days or less, depending on the operation) to fetch the latest content, which we then store in our internal database.

This approach enables:

- Reduced load on Seller systems
- Faster response times for Buyers

Buyers retrieve static content data from Travelgate's database, rather than directly from the supplier's API.
