:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Reservation Read

Reservation Read allows you to retrieve a specific booking with all its details using the lovators, booking codes. The returned fields for each booking in the list include: `Locators`, `Hotel`, `TransactionStatus`, `Holder`, `Price` etc.

:::caution

The amount of information returned might vary between Sellers.
