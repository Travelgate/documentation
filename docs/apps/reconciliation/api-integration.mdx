# API Integration

Our API is designed to help you integrate your system with Travelgate, enabling you to access our powerful
reconciliation solution. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your API integration,
so you can start reconciling bookings with ease.

## Before you start

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

* **GraphQL Knowledge**: Our API is built on GraphQL, so having a basic understanding of how it works will be helpful.
* **An active Travelgate account**
* **API Key**: You can generate an API key by logging into your Travelgate account and navigating to the
  [API Key](https://app.travelgate.com/settings/apikeys) section.

## General Information

You can send data to reconciliation from two different perspectives: as a Buyer or as a Seller. Graphql mutations and
queries are available for both perspectives. e.g: `bookingCreateSeller`, `bookingCreateBuyer`, `bookingCancelSeller`,
`bookingCancelBuyer`, etc.

**The code samples provided in this guide are written for a Seller perspective**. If you are a Buyer, you can use the same
mutations and queries by replacing the Seller with Buyer. e.g: `bookingCreateSeller` -> `bookingCreateBuyer` with a slight
modification in the input data: when you are a Buyer, you need to provide the `buyerIdentity` field in the input data and
when you are a Seller, you need to provide the `sellerIdentity` field in the input data.

When you update a booking, the field `updatedAt` is required in the `reservation` object. This field indicates the date
and time when the booking was updated in your system.

When you cancel a booking, the field `canceledAt` is required in the `reservation` object. This field indicates the date
and time when the booking was canceled in your system.

## Create a booking

You create a new booking by using `bookingCreateSeller` mutation. This mutation will create a new booking in the
system. Below is a full example of how to create a new booking.

```graphql
mutation BookingCreateSeller {
  reconciliation {
    bookingCreateSeller(
      input: {
        buyerReference: "test-202403061027",
        sellerReference: "test-202403061027",
        buyerIdentity: {
          travelgate: {
            buyerOrgCode: "xyz"
          }
        },
        reservation: {
          createdAt: "2024-02-28T09:00"
          netPayable: {
            amount: "50",
            currency: "EUR"
          },
          status: "CONFIRMED",

            }
          },
          cancellationPolicy: {
            refundable: true,
            penalties: [{
              value: "5",

              deadline: "2024-02-28T09:00"
            }, {
              value: "26",
              currency: "EUR",
              deadline: "2024-03-01T14:00"
            }]},

            },
            room: {
              codeSeller: "sel",
              description: "-"
            },
            guests: [{

            }, {
              age: 30
            }]
          }]
        }
      }
    ) {
