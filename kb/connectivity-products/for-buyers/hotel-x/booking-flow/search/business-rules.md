# Business Rules

## Which Business Rules Can Enhance My Search Requests?

Discover how specific business rules can strategically optimize your search requests, ensuring efficient and targeted results. Below are key rules designed to refine and tailor your searches effectively:

1. **CHEAPER_AMOUNT**: Returns the cheapest options without exceeding the optionsQuota limit.
2. **ROOM_TYPE**: Groups options by room type without exceeding the optionsQuota limit.

:::info optionsquota
The optionsQuota refers to the **maximum number of options per meal plan (board)** returned in a Search response. The default value is **300**, but it can be customized. The allowed values range from 1 to 300.

You can also configure your own Business Rules by implementing our [Aggregation plugin](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/overview). More details on Business Rules can be found in our [API Documentation](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart).

## Additional Considerations on Business Rules

When applying business rules, options are filtered using a limited combination of room types:

1. **Grouping by Room Type:** First, options with the same room type/classification are grouped together (e.g., Standard-Standard-Standard or Junior-Junior-Junior).
2. **Combining Cheapest Options:** Subsequently, the cheapest rooms are combined with the remaining ones, ensuring that duplicates are checked and the options do not exceed the specified optionsQuota limit.

If a Buyer specifies a BusinessRules value, it will be applied when the number of returned options surpasses the optionsQuota. However, if no business rules are specified, the default **CHEAPER_AMOUNT** rule will be applied.
