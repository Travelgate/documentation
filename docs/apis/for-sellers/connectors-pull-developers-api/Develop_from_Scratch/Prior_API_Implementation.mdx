# Develop a Connector

:::caution
### **Prior to the API implementation**

To ensure a successful implementation, candidates should possess the following foundational knowledge and skills:

1. **Solid Travel Trade business knowledge**: This includes understanding the intricate relationships and operational dynamics among hotels, sellers, and buyers, and how these entities typically interact with their partners.
2. **Proficiency in C# Programming**: A strong command of C# is preferred, as it is the primary programming language utilized in the development process. Candidates also must have a comprehensive understanding of software testing principles (Unit tests/Integration tests).
3. **Familiarity with Travelgate's Data Model**: A thorough understanding of how Travelgate processes and structures data pertaining to options, rooms, boards, and policies is crucial [(Check Travelgate's Business Model)](../Shopping_Workflow/#travelgates-business-model). This knowledge will facilitate accurate mapping and integration with the seller's API.

If ready to start the connector, please download the **template**

Clone the repository from Github where the integration will be created based on a template (The github **seller initials** will be given to the person developing)

https://github.com/travelgate-connectors/connectors-pull-hotel-shopping-INITIALS

This template will contain:

- Operations defined but unimplemented (e.g., methods throwing NotImplementedException).
- Empty models (requests and responses) for each supplier operation, which the developer will have to insert data such as the one above.
