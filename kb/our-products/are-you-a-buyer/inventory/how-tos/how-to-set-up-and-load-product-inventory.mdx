### For how long can I load product into Inventory?
Our Inventory system allows you to load allotment and prices for **up to 2 years** from the current date.

### How does room combination work in Inventory? Is it possible to share the allotment?
It is not possible to share the allotment. Rooms with the same code are considered the **same room**, regardless of the associated rates. Additionally, if the room capacity is less than the number of rooms requested, that combination will no longer be included in the availability. This avoids the risk of overbooking, generates more accurate room combinations, and enhances user experience and trust in the system.

### Is there any Remarks field for the rate/room in the Inventory API?
There isn't a dedicated Remarks field at the room level in Inventory. However, you can add remarks at the reservation request level. If needed, the room name field can be utilized to include room-specific details as free text.

### Can I request an activation for more than one credential (access) for the same Channel Manager?
It is not possible to request an activation for more than one credential for the same Channel Manager. However, our Inventory extranet offers many configuration options to set up your product according to your needs.  
Don't forget to check out our comprehensive [Documentation](/docs/apps/inventory/quickstart) for further information and make the most of your connection to Travelgate!

### I have not received a booking notification in my email, what can I do?
1. Check your setup for this hotel in the Extranet: Ensure that the Hotel Email, CC Address, and From Address are correct. If they are not, [update the information](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup#how-to-add-a-hotel) to ensure that booking notifications reach the expected emails. Remember that if you have modified a notification email, any reservations made prior to the change will have been sent to the previous email address.
2. Check the Spam and Trash folders: Make sure you haven't accidentally blocked or filtered the booking notification emails.  

If after reviewing these steps, you still do not receive the booking confirmation emails, feel free to contact our Customer Support team through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for further investigation.

### The currency I’m interested in isn't available in the dropdown list for rate setup. What should I do?
While our Inventory Extranet offers a comprehensive list of currencies, if you need one that's not listed, please reach out to us through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support). Our team will be happy to assist you.

### Booking Limit case example
**What will be the expected Inventory behaviour if you set a Booking Limit of 50, from January 15 to 30, applied to all days?**  

The 'Booking Limit' is the maximum number of reservations you can accept for a specific room on a specific day. If you set a 'Booking Limit' of 50 for the period from January 15 to January 30, it means you can accept up to 50 reservations for each of those days. Therefore, on Wednesday you can have a maximum of 50 reservations, on Thursday a maximum of 50 reservations, on Friday a maximum of 50 reservations, and so on.

Additionally, you can remove the availability (by date range) of conditions such as 'booking limit' (allocation), 'minimum or maximum stay duration', 'minimum or maximum length of stay upon arrival', and 'minimum or maximum release' as mentioned in the [documentation](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/availability-and-rates/manual-load/availability-and-price/).

Please note that these limits apply to each room type and not to the hotel as a whole. Therefore, if you have several room types, each room type can have its own 'Booking Limit'
