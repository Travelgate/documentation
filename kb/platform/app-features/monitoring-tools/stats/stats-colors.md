# Stats Color Guide

You may have noticed that some of your connections feature a yellow or red background. Don’t worry – we’re here to explain what these colors mean! 

In our dynamic Marketplace, which handles over 6 billion searches and 30,000 bookings each day, we gather a vast amount of data. This data helps us calculate typical error ratios for each step of the booking flow, and we’re excited to share these insights with you!

- **No color**: A connection with no color means it’s performing excellently with a low error ratio.
- **Yellow**: A yellow connection is performing well, but there’s room for improvement. Fine-tuning its error ratio could enhance performance.
- **Red**: A red connection indicates the error ratio needs attention. Errors should be reviewed to reduce them further.

Keep an eye on these color indicators to ensure the best performance for your connections!

Each scorecard displays the percentage of **NOK** (Not OK) transactions and includes an icon. Hover over the icon to see a tooltip showing the ideal error ratio for each connection.
