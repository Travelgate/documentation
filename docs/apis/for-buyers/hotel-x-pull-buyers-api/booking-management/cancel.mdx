# Cancel

The cancel operation allows you to cancel a booking made via Travelgate. The returned fields include:

* `status`
* `reference`
* `price`
* `holder`
* `hotel`
* `rooms`
* `rates`


## Cancel Inputs

When creating your cancel query, you have two different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings

```graphql
mutation {
    hotelX {
    cancel
      criteria: {}
      settings: {}
	}
}
```

<CautionSettingsHotelX />

### 1. Input

This mutation offers versatility in cancellation, with all fields marked as optional (`accessCode`, `language`, `hotelCode` etc.). You can decide between the two options for cancellation, either by `reference` or by `bookingID`, empowering you with the choice that suits you best.

To specify your cancel input you need to use the input `HotelCancelInput` in your mutation variables.

If you decide to cancel using only the `bookingID` from the booking response, here's how you should structure your input:

```js
{
    "input" : {
        "bookingID" : "1@1[241028[241029[230918[1[es[EUR[2[test_0123456789[2596391"
    }
}
```

On the other hand, if you prefer to cancel using the `accessCode`, `hotelCode`, and `reference` from the booking response, here's the format you should follow:

```js
{
    "input" : {
        "accessCode" : "2",
        "hotelCode" : "1",
        "reference" : {
            "supplier" : "2596391"
        }
    }
}
```

**Optional criteria**
* `reference`
* `bookingID`
* `accessCode`
* `language`
* `hotelCode`


:::caution Keep in mind

While not all criteria are required, you'll need to do one of two things to cancel a reservation: either use the `bookingID` from the booking response, or provide all the other criteria, including `accessCode`, `hotel`, and `reference`. This ensures a successful cancellation of the reservation.

:::

### 2. Settings 

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. By default, we apply the same configuration to all Hotel-X clients.

To specify your cancel settings you need to use the [`HotelSettingsInput` input](/api/inputs/hotel-settings-input) in your mutation variables:

```js
{
	"settings": {
		"client": "client_demo",
		"context": "HOTELTEST",
		"testMode": true,
		"auditTransactions": false,
		"timeout": 60000
	}
}
```

**Mandatory Settings:**
* `client`
* `context`
* `timeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for all supplier connections. Won't close client connection if exceeded.)


**Optional Settings:**
* `group`
* `auditTransactions` 
* `suppliers` (Each one contains its own code, settings and accesses)
* `plugins`
* `testMode` (This flag allows only the accesses checked as test)
* `clientTokens` (Used to identify the origin of the request, this is only used in plugins)
* `commitRequired` (Indicates if the book will be confirmed in 1 or 2 steps. It only should be used in Book)
* `businessRules`
* `operationTimeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for Hotel-X connection. Will close Buyer connection if exceeded. Must be higher than `timeout`.)


:::caution Remember
Keep in mind that if you leave some of the fields in the `settings` inputs unspecified, we will use the values from your default settings. You can review and control your default API settings by visiting the [API Settings section](https://app.travelgatex.com/connections/settings) on our website.

### Requests Examples

#### Cancel with the `bookingID` from the book response

<GraphqlSample query={cancelMutation} variables={cancelByBookingIDVariables} />

#### Cancel using the `accessCode`, `hotelCode` and `reference` from the book response

<GraphqlSample query={cancelMutation} variables={cancelByReferenceVariables} />


## Cancel Response


Keep in mind that the content of the Cancel response can differ depending on the Sellers. For instance, some Sellers might provide details about the hotel, while others may only offer information about the status and locators/references.

Next, we'll provide important information about some of the returned fields.

### Cancel Status

Once a Cancel method is run, our API response will provide its cancel status. This status represents the current status of the cancellation and can be categorized into four possible values:

| Status         | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CANCELLED`    | The reservation is cancelled.                                                                                                                                    |
| `OK`           | The reservation status is OK, is not cancelled.
| `ON_REQUEST`   | The reservation was completed but the product is still not available by the Seller, so the reservation goes into a waiting list. It is the Buyer’s responsibility to check if the booking is OK. |
| `UNKNOWN`      | The cancellation process through Travelgate was completed but due to a supplier error or a timeout, the reservation status is unknown. It is the Buyer’s responsibility to check if the booking is cancelled.   

:::danger Important

If you receive any of the "common errors" or a status other than "CANCELLED", it will be your responsibility as a Buyer to check the final status of the cancellation in the Seller's system.

### Cancel Penalty

Cancellation always takes into account the day and time of the destination in order to calculate what cancellation policy should be applied. UTC time.

            different penalty types. It is important to keep in mind that a booking may have more than one penalty type
            associated with it.
		   <ul>
				<li>NIGHTS: It indicates the number of nights to be penalized.</li>
				<li>PERCENT: It indicates the percentage to pay based on the option price (possible values between 0 and 100).</li>
