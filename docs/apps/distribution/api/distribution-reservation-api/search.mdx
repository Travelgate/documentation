# Search

This method allows searching for reservations primarily based on date filters, returning basic information for each matching reservation. 

## Request

**Mandatory criteria:**

To make a search, it is essential to set either a bookingDate filter or a checkinDate filter, but not both at the same time (as this will result in an error). In both cases, the date range for the bookingDate filter and the checkinDate filter cannot exceed one week.

**Optional criteria:**

Optionally, you can filter your search by specifying specific hotels, providers, and clients. You can also choose to includeCancellations, onlyCancellations, onlyErrors, onlyLocators, orderBy and/or isTest.

```html
{
    "access" : {
        "accessToken" : "xxxx",
        "user" : "xxxx",
        "password" : "xxxx"
    },
    "bookingDate" : {
        "from" : "2018-07-18",
        "to" : "2018-07-20"
    },
    "hotels" : [
        "1234",
        "4534"
    ],
    "includeCancellations" : true
}
```
