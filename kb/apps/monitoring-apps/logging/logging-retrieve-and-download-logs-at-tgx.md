### What information does Logging provide me? 📤
If your search criteria returns logs, Logging will display the following information:
- Timestamp
- Duration of the transaction
- Connection
- Client
- Access
- Status/Error Code
- Operation type
- Session ID (as unique identifier for this transaction)
- Traffic Type (Basic, Optimized, Scheduler, Speed)
- Actions: Book Download and Quote Download. You can directly download the Quote transactions used for a specific booking flow. You can also download the logs visible on your screen by clicking the "Download All" button above the table.

- If your search returns many results, we recommend you use additional **filters** on the right: “Filter by Supplier”, “Filter by Access” or “Duration”:

:::info Legacy Pull Buyers API information
Please remember that for Buyer connections through our Legacy Pull Buyers API, filtering by Hotel-X Access Code is not available. Connections will be identified through the Buyer's **clientname#suppliercode** relationship.  
Note that some Buyers may be transitioning from the Legacy Pull Buyers API to the Hotel-X API, which means they could have traffic via both APIs. If in doubt, we strongly encourage you to **reach out to your Buyers** for more detailed information.
