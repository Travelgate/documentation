# ProviderNotActivated Warning

## What Does a ProviderNotActivated Warning Mean?
This warning appears in the Legacy Pull Buyers API response when a connection with the specified supplier hasn't been established or when the entered supplier code doesn't match the one assigned in [My Connections](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/managing-connections/connections-details#additional-access-information). Before proceeding, ensure that you have a commercial agreement with them and have [requested their activation](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).

### Example Response:
```
<warnings>
    <Warning>
        <warning>ProviderNotActivated:[Supplier_code]</warning>
    </Warning>
</warnings>
```

### What Can I Do If I Receive a ProviderNotActivated warning in my Response?
To resolve this issue:
1. **Verify Supplier Code**
   - Make sure you've included the correct provider code in your request. You can verify your Sellers' supplier codes directly in the ["My Connections"](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/managing-connections/connections-details#additional-access-information) section, at the Supplier and Access level.
   - Your request's provider code should always match the supplier code shown in "My Connections.
