# Travelgate Dashboard

## What Is the Travelgate Dashboard? 
The **Travelgate Dashboard** is a centralized platform within the Travelgate Portal that provides users with a comprehensive overview of their connections' performance, reported issues, and traffic optimization insights. It offers real-time access to key metrics such as booking performance, search volumes, and Smart Traffic APP recommendations.

Additionally, it features customizable reports covering various time frames, helping Buyers and Sellers track and optimize their operations effectively. Access to these insights is granted once an initial connection is established, enabling users to fully leverage the Marketplace Dashboard's potential. 

## How Can I Access My Dashboard? 
1. Log into our [Portal](https://www.travelgate.com/).
2. Make sure you are browsing as a Buyer or a Seller, depending on the information you want to visualize.
3. Click on **"Dashboard"** in the top menu.
4. Once in your Dashboard, you'll find:
   - A detailed summary of your connections' performance.
   - The latest status of your Cases.
   - Information on our **Smart Traffic APPs**.
   - Various reports that can be customized based on specific date ranges.

These reports can provide data from the previous day, last week, or even the past month. Remember, you'll **only be able to access these Dashboard reports once you've set up your initial connection**.

So, let's establish that connection and start harnessing the potential of the **Marketplace Dashboard**!
