Once completed, they will be able to access and explore the Travelgate platform.

:::info Can I change the email address for an existing user?
 No, you cannot update an existing user's email address. Instead, you'll need to **create a new user account** with the desired email and delete the old one.

### User Roles
Each user’s role determines what actions they can perform within the Travelgate APP:
- **Admin**: Can create new connections and make reservations via the Travelgate APP and API.
- **Editor**: Can review and update existing connections and make reservations.
- **Viewer**: Can view existing connections and perform searches and quotes.

### Can I reactivate users in my Organization?
**Yes, you can reactivate users if you have an Owner or Admin role**. To do so, follow the same steps used to add a new user: Navigate to the User Management screen, click "Invite a User," and complete the process.

If you don’t have the required permissions, please reach out to someone in your Organization who does, so they can reactivate the user for you.
