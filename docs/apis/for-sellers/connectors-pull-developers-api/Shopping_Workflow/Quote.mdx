## **Overview**

The `Quote` operation is a critical step in the booking workflow, used to confirm the details of an option previously retrieved in a `Search`. Since suppliers often rely on cached data or dynamic pricing, the `Quote` operation ensures that the selected option's price and policies are up-to-date before proceeding to a booking.

## **Purpose**
The `Quote` operation serves several purposes:
- **Price Validation**: Confirms the price of the selected option to account for potential changes since the `Search` response.
- **Policy Confirmation**: Validates the cancellation policies, payment terms, and other conditions tied to the selected option.
- **Data Reliability**: Ensures that all data is accurate and aligned with the supplier’s current availability before proceeding to the `Book` operation.

> **Note**: Always prioritize data from `Quote` over `Search`, as `Quote` reflects the most accurate and reliable information.

## **When to Use**
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Suppliers that update prices frequently require this step to confirm current rates.
- **Session-Based Suppliers**: For suppliers with expiring sessions or tokens, `Quote` helps ensure that the data remains valid.
- **Buyer Confidence**: Provides clients with an additional layer of assurance about the selected option’s details.

## **Response Details**
The `Quote` operation returns:
- **Updated Price Details**: Reflects any adjustments to the price since the initial `Search`.
- **Cancellation Policies**: Confirms the policies associated with the option, including penalties and deadlines.
- **Additional Details**: May include supplier-specific remarks or notes.

## **Common Scenarios**
- **Price Changes**: If the supplier's price differs from the `Search` response, the `Quote` operation will provide the updated price. 
  - Example: `PriceChanged` error code is returned if there’s a discrepancy. (See [Error Handling in Connectors](../Connector_Framework/Error_Handling_in_Connectors.mdx)).
- **Option No Longer Available**: If the selected option is no longer valid, the response may include an `ItemNotAvailable` error code.

## **Technical Details**

  - Represents the structure of the `Quote` request, including required fields such as `optionId` and `occupancy`.
