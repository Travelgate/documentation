# How to Use Alerts

## Alerts: Real-Time Detection of Potential Issues
Monitoring your system's performance is crucial to ensuring smooth operations. Travelgateâ€™s **Alerts** feature provides real-time detection of potential issues, helping you proactively manage disruptions. Whether it's error codes, traffic fluctuations, or L2B thresholds, setting up alerts enables you to stay informed and take immediate action when needed. This guide will walk you through the different alert types, how to configure them, and what to do when they are triggered.

## What Kinds of Alerts Can I Set Up?
- **Status Error Code**: Triggers an alert when the percentage of a specific error code exceeds the limit defined in your configuration.
- **L2B**: Triggers an alert if the L2B reaches or exceeds the configured threshold.
- **Traffic Peak**: Triggers an alert when traffic significantly increases or decreases compared to the configured levels.

## How Can I Use Alerts?
1. Log into [our Platform](https://www.travelgate.com/).
2. Navigate to **Monitoring > [Alerts](https://app.travelgate.com/alerts)**.
3. Access the **Alerts Dashboard**, where you can view all configured alerts for your organization and their details:
