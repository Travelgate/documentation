# Guidelines for Submitting Support Cases

At Travelgate, we are committed to providing top-notch support. To ensure your cases are addressed efficiently and effectively, please follow these valuable guidelines:

### Check our Knowledge Base first🔎
Before raising a case through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/travelgatex-tickets), we recommend checking our Knowledge Base, as someone may have already reported your issue. You might find a solution or procedure to follow, saving you time and enabling you to resolve the issue autonomously.

### Ask AIna💡

### Separate cases for different connections or issues⚠️
If you have multiple connections or issues that need analysis, please raise a separate case for each one. Each integration has its own specifications, and not all errors are caused by the same root issue. By creating separate cases, our team can focus on each problem individually and find the most effective solution.
### Keep updates in one thread✔️
If you need additional details or updates on an ongoing case, please don't create a new case or email thread. Instead, reply to the existing thread for that specific case. This ensures that all the information is stored in one place and avoids miscommunications.

### Select the right category💡
When creating a cases, make sure to select the appropriate option or category that best describes your issue or request. This helps us categorize and prioritize cases, making it easier and faster for our team to address the problem.

### What information does our Support team need?🛠️
If you're reporting an issue, please provide the following details:

- **Connectivity information**: Include the names of the Buyer and Seller, the credentials to be analyzed (AccessCode/s), the method used (Search, Quote, Book, etc.), and a description of the issue or error encountered.
- **TravelgateX logs**: These [logs](/kb/apps/monitoring-apps/logging/logging-retrieve-and-download-logs-at-tgx) are essential for our analysis. If you're a Seller reporting an error from one of your Buyers, please provide the complete RQ/RS logs generated by the Buyer when using the TravelgateX API. If you're a Buyer, please ensure you share the [complete RQ/RS](/kb/apps/monitoring-apps/logging/how-can-i-receive-seller-transactions-in-their-api-format) logs from your end. If you come across any errors in the Booking Flow and Management, kindly provide us with the method's timestamp, along with the supplier/client references and, if applicable, the bookingID.
- **Web logs:** If you're experiencing an error on your website, please check our Knowledge Base for instructions on [how to retrieve web logs](/kb/tickets/how-to-retrieve-web-logs-from-website#how-can-i-obtain-travelgatex-website-logs%EF%B8%8F).
- **Additional snapshots or information**: We highly value your contribution and appreciate any extra snapshots or information you can share.
