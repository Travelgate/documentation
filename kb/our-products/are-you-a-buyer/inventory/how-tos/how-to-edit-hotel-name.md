# How to edit a hotel name in the Inventory Extranet

### Manage Hotel Name Changes More Efficiently!

If a hotel changes its name and you need to update it in our Extranet, you can easily manage this on your own by following these steps:

1. Make sure the new name is **exactly the same** as the one provided on the hotel's official website. Just use the hotel name without any extra references such as the hotel chain.
2. Check if your user role is **“Client” or “Client Admin”**. If it’s not, simply reach out to a team member who has these permissions.
3. Submit a Case in our Portal - Section [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support) - to request permissions to modify a hotel name.
4. That’s it! Once our team processes your request, you’ll be able to manage this information directly.

Please note that even if your user has Admin permissions, only the Travelgate team can modify the hotel name if it is also assigned to another client. If this is the case, don’t worry! Feel free to contact our team through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support), and we will be happy to assist you!
