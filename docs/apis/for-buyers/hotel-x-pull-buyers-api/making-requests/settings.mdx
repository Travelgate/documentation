# Hotel-X Settings

In all booking flow and booking management requests, you'll find certain fields that you need to fill in. These include the `HotelSettingsInput` and `criteria` inputs. These fields contain various elements, some of which are known as `settings`. These settings are the common configurations used to construct your requests to the supplier/s. They consist of fields that are frequently needed, like `language`, `currency`, and `timeout`.

You have the flexibility to fill in these settings with different values for each of your `query` and `mutation` requests. However, to make things easier, you can also choose not to fill them in every time, especially if you know the values will remain the same. In such cases, we have default settings. These default settings are the values we'll use in the background if you don't specify the fields that are part of these settings.

:::info Remember!

When you begin using Travelgate, these settings are automatically created, but it's essential to review and update them according to your preferences in our [API Settings](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/api-settings) website section.

## Settings fields

We'll clarify which fields are categorized as `settings` and where you can locate them. We'll also specify whether it's mandatory to provide a value for each field or if you have the option to leave it empty, in which case the default settings will be applied:

| Field                  | Mandatory / Optional | Where to Fill It                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `client`               | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input)                                  |
| `context`              | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `timeout`              | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `businessRules`        | Mandatory            | Query (Settings input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `language`             | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `currency`             | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `nationality`          | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `markets`              | Mandatory            | Query (Criteria input) or Default Settings will be used |
| `optionsQuota`         | Optional             | Query (Criteria input), default settings or 300 will be used as value. This sets the maximum number of options returned per board in a search. If not specified in the query, the system will use the value from your Hotel-X API default settings. If no value is set there, the system will default to 300 options. |
| `useOnlyValidatedFastXCodes` | Optional       | Configurable only in the [API Settings](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/api-settings) section on the website. Default value is `false`. When enabled, **only requests using validated FastX hotel and board codes will be allowed**. If set to `false`, all validated and pending FastX codes will be allowed. More info about FastX codes can be found [here](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/fastx-codes). |


## Default settings levels

Understanding the various levels at which default settings can be applied is crucial for tailoring your configurations precisely to your needs:

1. **Organization/Group Level**: Settings at this level apply to the entire organization or Hotel-X group.

> Hotel-X groups refer to a group of clients to which you can apply different business rules. 
> By default, as a Buyer, you only have one Hotel-X group. You don’t need to worry about having more than one unless you have very specific business needs. If you do, please contact our Customer Care team.

2. **Client Level**: Settings at this level are specific to individual clients. This means that default settings set for a particular client will only affect that client.

3. **Supplier Level**: These settings are tailored to specific suppliers. Default settings set for a particular supplier will impact all accesses associated with that supplier.

4. **Access Level**: Settings set at this level apply to a specific access. This implies that they will only affect that access. These settings take precedence over settings at the organization/group, client, and supplier levels.

5. **Query/Mutation Level**: These settings are those you, as a Buyer, specify in your query or mutation. Regardless of the default settings configured at other levels, these settings take precedence and will override them.

:::warning 
Settings defined in your API request (at the query or mutation level) override all other default settings. The priority order (from highest to lowest) is: Query/Mutation > Access > Supplier > Client > Organization.

You can configure and adjust all these default settings at the [API Settings](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/api-settings) section on our website.
