# Markets Group

Markets Group plugin groups the input markets from Search depending on the agrupations you‚Äôve decided beforehand. In order to be able to use the plugin, you‚Äôll have to decide which markets to join for which supplier. This way the Search will only process as many transactions as groups have been formed by the plugin, since all of the markets of a same group would return the same options.

To get started with the Markets Group plugin, follow these simple steps:

## 1. Create and Upload your Markets Group File

To get started, create your markets markets_groups file in the correct format and then upload it to your SFTP account. We've provided a template file below ‚¨áÔ∏è to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your own rules, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your SFTP.


```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

üìÅHotelX  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅHotelX_0000  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅBusinessRules  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **üìÑ[markets_groups.csv](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/markets_group.csv)**

</BrowserWindow>
```

:::caution

Keep in mind that this plugin is only available in Search step and the markets groups will not be recalculated after Search step. So if you take an option from Search that has been executed with market groups, those groups will remain the same through all the booking flow, even if you change those groups via SFTP.
