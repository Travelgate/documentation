:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Metadata

The MetaData method returns a clear and summarized view of the Seller's main characteristics, as well as the methods implemented through their integration and the limitations and restrictions associated with their connection. The returned fields include:`MaxNumberHotels`, `AllowsCurrency`, `MinimumStay`, `PaymentTypes`, `InformFees`, `TimeZone`, `AllowsDeltaPrice`, `AllowsProvideLocator ` etc.

:::caution

The amount of information and content returned might vary between Sellers.
