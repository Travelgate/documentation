# Channel-X

## What is Channel-X? 

**Channel-X** extracts product data loaded by Channel Managers into our [Inventory](/kb/connectivity-products/for-buyers/inventory/inventory-solution) tool and pushes it directly into the system of a Travelgate Partner, typically an OTA (Buyer).

With Channel-X, you have full control over when and what product data to refresh. This powerful tool ensures your prices, availability, and inventory stay up to dateâ€”acting as the perfect bridge between your system and the Channel Managers you're connected with!

:::info Real-time Inventory Updates   
Channel-X delivers **real-time Inventory updates**, keeping your system synchronized. However, if you prefer, you can also purchase from Channel Managers using our **Hotel-X Pull Buyers API**, giving you the flexibility to choose the best option for your needs.
