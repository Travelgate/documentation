# Requote

The **Requote** plugin allows you to activate, deactivate, and set up any Requote app available in the Travelgate marketplace.

Requote helps you find better options when you request a quote from a supplier. It checks if other of your suppliers in the Marketplace can offer the same or better conditions at a lower price.

With Requote, you can:

* See cheaper or better-value alternatives for the same hotel.

* Compare offers from different suppliers before the booking confirmation.

* Choose at the book step whether to go with your original option or one of the suggested alternatives.


:::note
To use this feature, you must have at least one Requote app activated in the Travelgate Apps Marketplace.
:::

## 1. Execute Requote Price Plugin in your Query

To use the plugin, add the following field to the settings node of your request. Note that the Requote plugin can be executed during a quote request (quote step). To successfully execute the Requote plugin, you need to create the request with the following variables:

* **`name`**: "*appSupplier*.*appName*.*version*"
* **`enable`**: "true/false". You'll need to indicate if you want to use the APP in your quote query with this boolean. 
* **`parameters`**: list of parameters depending on the APP supplier.


For instance, to use the Requote app from Travelgate:

```js
"settings": {
    "plugins" : [
        {
            "pluginsType" : [
                {
                    "name" : "tgx.requote.1",
                    "enable" : "true",
                    "parameters" : [
                        {
                            "key" : "key",
                            "value" : "value"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## 2. Read the Requote results

When you execute a **quote query** with the Requote plugin enabled, make sure to request also the field "apps > requote" to obtain in your response the new information. 
In this field, you will receive:

* A list of alternative options from other suppliers, already evaluated by the app. These options include the same level of detail as your original quote response.
* In each alternative option, the **`savings`** node indicates how much you can save compared to your original quoted option.

```js
{
    "data" : {
        "hotelX" : {
            "quote" : {...}, *original quote response from your request*
                "apps" : {
                    "requote" : {
                        "appSupplierCode" : "TGX",
                        "options" : [
                            {
                                "savings" : {
                                    "value" : 36,
                                    "currency" : "EUR"
                                },
                                "optionQuote" : {...}
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


Once you have the results:

1. Review the alternative options and savings.
2. Decide which option is best for your business.
3. For the **book** step, use the `optionID` of the option you finally want to confirm.
