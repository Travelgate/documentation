## **Overview**

The `Search` operation is the entry point in the booking workflow, enabling clients to retrieve available options based on their specific requirements. It allows buyers to query for availability, pricing, and other relevant details about accommodations offered by the supplier.

## **Purpose**
The `Search` operation is used to:
- Fetch available options that match specific criteria provided by the client.
- Provide detailed information about available rooms, prices, and policies.
- Act as a foundation for subsequent operations like `Quote` and `Book`.

## **Criteria for Search**
Clients can define their search criteria to narrow down the available options. Common search parameters include:
- **Hotel Codes**: Specific properties to search within.
- **Occupations**: Number of guests, their ages, and nationalities.
- **Markets**: Specific geographic or demographic markets targeted by the client.
- **Check-in and Check-out Dates**: The desired date range for the stay.

## **Response Details**
The `Search` operation returns a list of available options matching the criteria. Each option includes:
- **Price Details**: Comprehensive breakdowns of pricing, including base prices, taxes, and fees.
- **Room Information**: Descriptions of the rooms, including amenities, room types, and occupancy limits.
- **Cancellation Policies**: Policies related to cancellations, including deadlines and penalties.
- **Remarks**: Supplier-specific notes or disclaimers.
- **Rate Rules**: Conditions and restrictions associated with specific rates, such as minimum stay requirements.


## **Technical Details**
- **Request Object**: 
  - Represents the structure of the search request as expected by the supplier.
