# Seller API Development Roadmap

At Travelgate, we believe in the power of collaboration and innovation. That's why we've introduced our [Seller API Development Roadmap](https://app.travelgate.com/network/roadmap). This roadmap is all about providing transparency, helping you plan your product strategy effectively with a clear view of our plans and progress.

As we move beyond our Legacy Pull Sellers API, now deprecated, we are dedicated to continuous improvement. Today, we take the lead in developing all new API integrations, ensuring you remain at the forefront of technology.

Our roadmap outlines the integrations we're adding to our Marketplace, keeping you ahead in the fast-paced, ever-changing travel industry. We understand the importance of staying competitive, and Travelgate is here to support you.

It is also all about **scalability**. As your business grows, our technology grows with you, providing the resources you need to excel. We're committed to your growth journey, equipping you with the tools and capabilities to thrive in the exciting world of travel.
