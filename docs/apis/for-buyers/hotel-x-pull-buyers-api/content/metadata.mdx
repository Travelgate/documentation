:::note

Travelgate API specifications will always prevail over the Seller's specifications. For instance, nationality should always be sent in SearchRQ even though it may be optional for some Sellers.

Since Metadata information may not be updated by our Sellers frequently (they update it whenever there is a major update on their APIs), we suggest you confirm directly with them whether the information is up to date.
