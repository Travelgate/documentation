# Case Guidelines  

At Travelgate, we are committed to providing top-notch support. To ensure your cases are handled efficiently and effectively, please follow these guidelines:  

## Check Our Knowledge Base First 
Before submitting a case through our [Support Portal](/kb/platform/support-portal/how-to-submit-case), we recommend searching our [Knowledge Base](/kb). You might find a solution or troubleshooting steps that allow you to resolve the issue independently, saving you time.  

## Ask AIna
AIna, our custom Large Language Model (LLM), is designed to answer Travelgate-specific questions based on our Official Documentation. Integrated seamlessly into our Customer Support Portal, AIna enhances your support experience by providing quick and relevant answers.  

📌 Check out the [AIna User Guide](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/support-resources/aina-user-guide) for tips on how to interact with AIna effectively.

## File Cases Individually
If you have multiple connections or issues that require analysis, please submit a separate case for each one. Each integration has unique specifications, and errors stem from different causes. By creating individual cases, our team can investigate each issue thoroughly and provide the best possible solution.  

## Keep Updates in One Thread
For ongoing cases, please reply within the existing case thread rather than opening a new one. Keeping all updates in a single conversation ensures that relevant information remains consolidated, preventing delays and miscommunication.  

## Select the Right Category  
When submitting a case, choose the most relevant category to describe your issue or request. Proper categorization helps us prioritize and process cases more efficiently.  

## What Information Does Our Support Team Need?
To facilitate a faster resolution, please include the following details when reporting an issue:  

- **Connectivity Information:** Provide the names of the Buyer and Seller, relevant AccessCodes, Client, Supplier, API in use.
- **Description of the Case:** Provide a detailed description (include snippets, method used, error information, etc.). This enables our virtual assistant, AIna, to potentially resolve your issue more quickly, and ensures our Support Team has all the necessary information to assist you effectively if further help is needed.
- **Travelgate Logs:**  
  - If you are a Seller reporting an error from a Buyer, provide the complete RQ/RS logs generated by the Buyer when using the Travelgate API.  
  - If you are a Buyer, share the [complete RQ/RS logs](/kb/platform/app-features/monitoring-tools/logging/audit-supplier-transactions) from your end.  
  - For Booking Flow and Management errors, include the timestamp of the method call, supplier/client references, and the booking ID (if applicable).  
  - Retrieve and download logs via our [Logging guide](/kb/platform/app-features/monitoring-tools/logging/logging-details).  
- **Web Logs:** If the issue occurs on your Platform, follow the steps in our Knowledge Base to [retrieve web logs](/kb/platform/support-portal/how-to-retrieve-web-logs-from-website).  
- **Additional Snapshots or Information (if necessary):** Any extra screenshots or relevant details you can provide will be helpful for troubleshooting.  

## Minor API Updates by Sellers
If you're a Seller notifying us of an API update (minor or maintenance-related), please include your updated API Documentation for review.  

## The Support Portal Page Fails to Load – What Can I Do?  
If you experience issues loading the Support Portal, try the following troubleshooting steps:  

1. **Check Your Internet Connection:** Ensure your device has a stable internet connection.  
2. **Try a Different Browser:** Browser-related issues can sometimes affect page loading. Test the page in another browser.  
3. **Clear Your Browser’s Cache and Cookies:** Corrupt cache or cookies may cause loading failures. Clear them and reload the page.
