# Travelgate Dashboard

## What Is the Travelgate Dashboard? 
The **Travelgate Dashboard** is a centralized interface within the Travelgate Platform designed to give usersâ€”both Buyers and Sellersâ€”a clear, real-time overview of their connection performance.

**Key features include:**
   - Live performance statistics
   - GMV charts
   - Pending account-level actions (e.g., missing contacts, invoice reviews)
   - Customizable reports covering different time frames

These insights empower users to monitor and optimize their operations efficiently. Access to the Dashboard is granted **once an initial connection is successfully established**. After that, you can unlock the full potential of the Marketplace Dashboard.

## How Can I Access My Dashboard?

Follow these steps to access your Dashboard:
1. Log in to the [Travelgate Platform](https://www.travelgate.com/).
2. Make sure you're browsing as either a Buyer or Seller, depending on the data you want to view.
3. Click on **"Travelgate"** in the left side of the top navigation menu.

Once inside your Dashboard, youâ€™ll find the following sections:

### Left Panel

- **Pending Actions:**
This section highlights tasks that require your attention. Examples include:
   - Reviewing invoice information
   - Setting up contacts
   - Providing feedback

- **Latest Blog Articles:** Discover the latest [Travelgate news](https://news.travelgate.com/), expert insights, and feature updatesâ€”designed to help you stay ahead and get the most out of the platform.
