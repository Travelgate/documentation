# Content Discrepancies

### Why am I not receiving the content expected from a Seller?🔎
This can occur for the following reasons:

1. Your content has not been updated yet. Find more information on how to review and manage your content using our APP [here](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content.md).
2. If you encounter 0 hotels ('There is no data to display') in the My Connections Content section, you should manually force a content update for that access through the [“Force Content Now”](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality) tool. Remember, if you've reactivated an access that was previously deactivated, it will always show 0 properties until the next scheduled automatic update occurs or until you manually force the update through the "Force Content Now" functionality. Content updates are only carried out for [active accesses](/kb/connections/my-connections/#what-can-i-find-in-my-connections) on our platform.
3. The Seller has not provided certain mandatory fields, resulting in the exclusion of some items (e.g., hotels, destinations).
4. The Seller has not sent those particular items.

### What can I do to manage this discrepancy?🚀
1. Reach out to the Seller to ensure they are sending the missing information, including all the required fields expected at an integration level.
2. If the issue persists, you may [force an update of your content](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality).
3. If the problem continues even after forcing an update of your content, please [open a Case](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) to our Customer Support Team for further investigation.

### What can I do if I receive an error or an empty response while downloading my content?💡
1. Make sure the credentials in your request (Hotel-X Access Code or Legacy Configuration) are active and operative.
2. Ensure that your request complies with our API requirements. Also, when querying hotel information for portfolios with concatenated hotel codes, ensure that the hotel codes are included in the request with the specified concatenation. For more details regarding concatenated hotel codes, click [here](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/static-content/hotel-x-hotels-query/#what-is-the-difference-between-hotelcode-and-hotelcodesupplier%EF%B8%8F).
3. Check our [list of errors and warnings](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/lists-of-errors-and-warnings/overview) for further information. 
4. If you encounter an error or an empty response while downloading your content, we recommend [forcing an update](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality). Once it's complete, restart the download process.
5. If the issue persists or the error code received is not listed, please open a Case through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) for further investigation.

:::info Force Content Updates
When conducting a 'Force content now' update to refresh a Seller's portfolio, note that the duration of the update depends on the **size of the content**. The update is managed through a **queue system** and will proceed when it reaches its turn - This could take anywhere from a few minutes to 24-72 hours. If the update has not completed after this time, you may attempt to force the update again.

Please note that **updates within 72 hours fall within the expected update time frame**, so there is no need to contact the Support Team before this period ends.

Besides, keep in mind that if you force an update for a large set of accesses, such as updating all accesses for a Supplier across all Buyers, will result in **a longer queue**, thereby increasing the overall update duration.

In cases where you've followed the steps above and still do not have the most up-to-date content, please don't hesitate to reach out through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team) for further help. We're here to ensure you have the best possible experience!
