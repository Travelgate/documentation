# No Results Found (Push Suppliers)

### What Does a 204 Error Mean? 
A 204 error occurs when a Supplier does not return any results for the specific Search criteria set in the Buyer's request (e.g., hotel, dates, market, etc.).

For more details, see our article on [204 error - No results found](/kb/connectivity-products/for-buyers/errors-and-warnings/error-no-results-found).

### What Are the Typical Causes of a "No Availability" Error for Push Suppliers? 
Below are the possible reasons for availability not being displayed for Push Suppliers, along with their solutions:

#### 1. **Deactivated Hotel/Rates/Rooms**
   - Check the **SetUp** section to ensure that the hotel, rates (and derived rates, if applicable), and rooms are not deactivated. Deactivated elements will be highlighted in red.

#### 2. **No Product Loaded for Requested Rates/Rooms/Occupancies**
   - If no product is loaded, availability results will not be obtained.

#### 3. **Ensure Room Setup Matches Desired Occupancies**
   - Verify that the [rooms](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup#room) are properly configured for all desired occupancies.

#### 4. **Close Sales, Close on Arrival, or Close on Departure Conditions Enabled for Requested Dates**
   - Days with **Close Sales** will be highlighted in red.
   - Days with **Close on Arrival** or **Close on Departure** will be highlighted in a different shade of green with a checkmark.

#### 5. **Incorrectly Loaded Booking Limit**
   - Verify that the booking limit has been correctly set up.

#### 6. **Mismatch in Search Criteria**
   - Ensure that the Search criteria in your request match the criteria previously configured in your SetUp and loaded for the relevant hotels, rates, or rooms (e.g., dates, occupancy, market, nationality, currency, etc.).
