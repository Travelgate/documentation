# Overview

For you as a seller, this part is optional. Our clients or the hoteliers work on setting up the inventory using the Inventory Extranet or this API. However, it is highly recommended. If you, as a Seller, have the option to set up the product in our system, it will automate the work that customers currently do manually. This ensures a much faster connection with customers interested in your products, as once the connection is requested in Travelgate, you can upload hotels into our inventory using this process and they will start purchasing instantly. There is no need to wait for the manual setup period, which can sometimes be more tedious and labor-intensive.

Our GraphQL setup methods collection is designed to offer you flexibility and control, allowing you to tailor your clients' inventory to meet specific market demands.

Each section of this guide provides detailed information on various aspects of product inventory management.

Throughout this section you will find the following common fields: 
* `clientCode`: It is your unique identifier as a Buyer in Inventory. It can be retrieved from any TravelgateX access with a Channel Manager. See My Connections and click "Get form data" in the selected access. The code in `Password` is your `ClientCode`.
* `supplierCode`: It is the unique identifier of a Channel Manager in Inventory. It is the `User` in the TravelgateX access.
* `hotelCode`: It is the code of a hotel in Inventory. It can be equivalent to the `hotelId` generated by our system or it can be the native hotel code from the Channel Manager.
* `contextCode`: It is the Inventory Context linked to a hotel. It is required in case the hotel is from a specific Channel Manager, otherwise, it can be ommited or filled with "TGX_PUSH".

:::note

The possible values for `contextCode` can be retrieved using the query [Inventory Contexts](../static-data/inventory-contexts).
