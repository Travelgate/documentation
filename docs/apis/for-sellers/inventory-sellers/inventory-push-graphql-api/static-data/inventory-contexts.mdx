# Inventory Contexts

`Inventory Context` is a term used to describe hotel codes used in Inventory. This should not be confused with the standard concept [Context](/docs/get-started/key-concepts#context); as this `Inventory Context` is exclusively related to the Inventory scope.  
Some Channel Managers need to work with their native hotel codes instead of mapping the Inventory hotel IDs that we autogenerate. Therefore, these Channels will require a special `Inventory Context` for Set Up and Product Load operations.  
As a Buyer connected to a Push Seller, the only alteration if the seller is a Channel Manager configured with a `Inventory Context`, will be that in the hotel list you will receive the native hotel codes instead of the hotel IDs.

To retrieve the `Inventory Context` values, you can use the `inventoryContexts` query that returns a list of all the existing Inventory Contexts created. The returned fields include:

* `contextId`
* `contextCode`
* `supplierCodes`
