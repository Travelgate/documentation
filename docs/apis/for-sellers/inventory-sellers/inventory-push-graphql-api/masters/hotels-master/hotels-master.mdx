## Query Inputs

When building your `hotelsMaster` query, you have 1 input to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria


### 1. Criteria   

This query offers 3 alternative ways of retrieving hotel masters:

- By Hotel code and context
- By country
- By locality


**Optional input**
* `countryCodes`

### Requests Examples

#### Search for Hotel masters by their code

When searching by hotel code, it is important to know that the default value of the field `contextCode` will be "TGX_PUSH", so if the hotels to retrieve
are from a supplier that works with native codes, their respective Inventory Context must be passed in the field  `contextCode`. 

:::note

The possible values for `contextCode` can be retrieved using the query [Inventory Contexts](../../static-data/inventory-contexts).

:::

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsMasterQuery} variables={hotelsMasterByHotelCodesVariables} />

#### Search for the full list of Hotel masters linked to a specific Inventory Context

Another possibility is to retrieve directly all the hotels linked to a specific Inventory Context. For that, fill in your input just the Inventory Context in the field `contextCode`.

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsMasterQuery} variables={hotelsMasterByContextCodeVariables} />

#### Search for Hotel masters by country

When utilizing the Hotels Query, for more personalized results, filter specific hotels based on your interests. For example, to focus solely on hotels located in Spain, add the `countryCode` field with "ES" in your input:

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsMasterQuery} variables={hotelsMasterByCountryCodeVariables} />

#### Search for Hotel masters by locality

Similarly to the previous query, to filter the results and retrieve only hotels from a specific Locality, for example, Palma de Mallorca, set your query variables as follows:

:::note

The `localityId` value from the desired Locality, can be retrieved using the queries [Localities](../../static-data/localities/) or [Search Localities](../../static-data/localities/search-localities).
