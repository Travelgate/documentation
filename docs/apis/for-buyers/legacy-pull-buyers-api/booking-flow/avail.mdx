:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

:::

# Avail

Avail serves as the initial step in our booking flow, with the objective of verifying availability within the specified date range, itinerary and the requested number of guests. It provides a comprehensive list of available options based on your search criteria. The returned fields include:  `Hotel code`, `Hotel name`, `Meal Plan code`, `paymentType`, `Rooms`, `Price`, `CancelPenalties` etc.

:::caution

The amount of information returned might vary between Sellers.

### How to Set Options Returned by MealPlan

The Legacy Pull Buyers API allows to set the number of options returned by MealPlan for suppliers who provide a large number of options, about 20.000+ in a single response.

This functionality is applicable as long as the supplier permits it. You can verify it in the [MetaData call](../content/meta-data/) under `AllowsBusinessRules`. If the supplier has AllowsBusinessRules = True, you can then choose from between different `BusinessRules` (CheaperAmount or RoomType) to filter the options based on your preferences.

:::note

We have implemented a system-level limit. If the `optionsQuota` set by the client exceeds this limit, the smaller of the two values will be used.

:::

To include the optionsQuota in your request, follow these steps:

1. Add the optionsQuota field to the request and specify the desired quantity of options per MealPlan.

2. Specify the BusinessRules you want to apply in the request: CheaperAmount or RoomType.

3. Upon receiving a response, you will only obtain a portion of the complete list. The number of options per MealPlan will be in accordance with your defined optionsQuota, considering the specified BusinessRules.


**1. Add optionsQuota in the Request**

First, in your Avail request you will add `optionsQuota` field and specify the desired quantity of options per MealPlan expected to receive in the response:

```xml
<AvailRQ>
   <timeoutMilliseconds>18000</timeoutMilliseconds>
   <source>
      <languageCode>en</languageCode>
   </source>
   <filterAuditData>
      <registerTransactions>true</registerTransactions>
   </filterAuditData>
   //highlight-start
   <optionsQuota>300</optionsQuota>
   //highlight-end
   <Configuration>
      ...
   </Configuration>
```

**2. Specify the BusinessRules in the request**

Then, specify the `BusinessRules` you want to apply in the request: CheaperAmount or RoomType.

```xml
<AvailRQ>
   <timeoutMilliseconds>18000</timeoutMilliseconds>
   <source>
      <languageCode>en</languageCode>
   </source>
   <filterAuditData>
      <registerTransactions>true</registerTransactions>
   </filterAuditData>
   <optionsQuota>300</optionsQuota>
   <Configuration>
      ...
   </Configuration>
   //highlight-start
   <BusinessRules>CheaperAmount</BusinessRules>
   //highlight-end
```

**3. You will recieve the Response**

You will recieve the Response with 300 options per MealPlan in accordance with your defined `optionsQuota`, considering the specified `BusinessRules`.


## Avail Response

After each request, the Seller will process the data and provide you with a response. Upon receiving a `Avail` request, the Seller will send you a corresponding `Avail` response. 

The response options include either **success** or an **error**. In the event of success, the response will be structured hierarchically, beginning with key Hotel details such as names and codes. Subsequently, there is a breakdown of MealPlans and their associated codes. Within the MealPlans, the Options section offers comprehensive information on various choices. Each option is a unique combination of  rooms, prices, and policies, providing a comprehensive view of the available selections.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>How should I interpret "binding" and "commission" to figure out what kind of price it is?</summary>

```xml
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "200" binding = "false" commission = "-1"/>
```

<p>We have no way of knowing if the price is PVP or net, given that the commission is not sent to us via XML. The commission is established by contract.</p>

```xml
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "300" binding = "true" commission = "-1"/>
```

<p>The price is PVP, the commission is not sent to us via XML. The commission is established by contract.</p>

```xml
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "150" binding = "true/false" commission = "20"/>
```

<p>The price is PVP with a commission of 20%. The binding in this case can be true or false.</p>

```xml
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "100" binding = "false" commission = "0"/>
```

<p>The price is net.</p>

<details>
<summary>Why does the "quantity" sometimes show as 0 in a service linked to a point of interest?</summary>
<b>Quantity = 0</b>

```xml
<POIs>
   <POI code = "8A" Description = "Andorra">
      <Services>
         <Service type = "SkiPass" code = "F1"
         description = "Forfait" durationType = "Range"
         quantity = "0" unit = "Day">
            <RangeDates startDate = "28/01/2014"
            endDate = "29/01/2014"/>
         </Service>
      </Services>
   </POI>
</POIs>
```

<p>Specifying the quantity is unnecessary as the start and end dates for the service have already been set.</p>

<b>Quantity > 0</b>

```xml
<POIs>
   <POI code = "8A" Description = "Andorra">
      <Services>
         <Service type = "SkiPass" code = "F1"
         description = "Forfait" durationType = "open"
         quantity = "5" unit = "Hour">
         </Service>
      </Services>
   </POI>
</POIs>
```

<p>In this case, quantity is applicable for the entire stay, i.e., the client can enjoy the skipass for 5 hours any day of the stay.</p>

```xml
<POIs>
   <POI code = "8A" Description = "Andorra">
      <Services>
         <Service type = "SkiPass" code = "F1"
         description = "Forfait" durationType = "open"
         quantity = "2" unit = "Day">
         </Service>
      </Services>
   </POI>
</POIs>
```

<p>In this case, quantity is applicable for the entire stay, i.e., the client can enjoy until 2 days of skipass in between the check in and check out.</p>
