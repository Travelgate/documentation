# How to Create API Keys

:::warning Important
Only users with **Admin permissions** can generate new API keys.
:::

You can follow these steps to create a new API key for your Organization:

1. **Provide a Name and Description**: Enter a name and description for your new API key. This helps in organizing and identifying different keys.

2. **Copy the API Key**: Once the key is generated, you’ll see the full API key value. Make sure to copy and store it securely, as this is the only time the key will be visible. **You cannot retrieve the key once it’s been created**, so be sure to keep a copy. Previous keys will remain active.
