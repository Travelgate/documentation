# How to edit & customize your Company Profile

Our [Partner Network Directory](https://app.travelgate.com/network/partners) was born with the purpose of not only to increase the visibility of our connections, but also to build an environment that fosters networking and business opportunities. Your [Company Profile](https://app.travelgate.com/settings/company-profile) is your chance to stand out with engaging content designed to attract attention!

### How can I set up my Company Profile?🛠️
1. Log into our [Portal](https://www.travelgate.com/).
1. Click on "Settings" and select "Company Profile".
1. Alternatively, you can access your Profile directly from Travelgate Network, filtering by Company.

	:::info
	Please note that you can only edit your profile if you are an **Owner or Admin** user in your Organization. If you have a different role, you will see a message stating that your current role restricts company editing. In that case, please contact the Administrator or Owner for profile adjustments. You can find more information on user roles [here](/kb/account-settings/users-management/how-to-add-manage-users-to-organization).
