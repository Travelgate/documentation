# Hotel Portfolio

## What Information Does This Report Provide?

The [Hotel Portfolio Report](https://app.travelgate.com/insights/hotel-portfolio) provides insights into how hotels are requested within your connections over a specific period. It helps identify the volume of hotels that are no longer available in the Seller's portfolio.

The data is based on search requests from the **previous week (Monday to Sunday)** and is updated every **Monday morning**.

Requested hotels are categorized into two statuses:

- **Hotels in Portfolio:** Indicates that all searched hotels were available in the Seller's portfolio, meaning the search requests were correct.
- **Hotels Not in Portfolio:** Indicates that some hotels searched are no longer in the Seller's portfolio. Since searches for these hotels increase the **No Availability rate**, we recommend updating the portfolio to improve connectivity performance.

## Who Can Access This Report?

Both **Buyers and Sellers** have access to this report to monitor portfolio requests within their connections:

- **Buyers:** Can use this report to verify whether they are correctly requesting hotels from their Suppliers.
- **Sellers:** Can quickly detect whether Buyers are searching for the full portfolio needed to achieve optimal sales through Travelgate.


## What Should I Do Next?

If the report identifies **requested hotels that are not in the portfolio**, consider these two solutions to reduce unnecessary traffic and improve performance:

1. **Activate Traffic Optimizer:** Block traffic for hotels returning **No Availability** to streamline searches.
2. **Update Your Portfolio:** Ensure your portfolio reflects the latest version to avoid unnecessary search requests.

Both options are easy to implement and deliver significant improvements. Remember, collaboration between Buyers and Sellers is key to optimizing your connections!
