# HTTP Status Codes

## What Are HTTP Status Codes?

HTTP Status Codes are three-digit numbers generated by a server that indicate the result of an HTTP request.

Here are some common HTTP status codes you might encounter:

- **HTTP 200:** OK.
- **HTTP 401:** Unauthorized.
- **HTTP 403:** Forbidden.
- **HTTP 408:** Request Timeout.
- **HTTP 500:** Internal Server Error.
- **HTTP 503:** Service Unavailable.
- **HTTP 504:** Gateway Timeout.

### 580 Error Code

#### What does a 580 error mean?
A 580 error code typically indicates a network issue, specifically a "socket hang-up." This occurs when the socket fails to establish or maintain a connection within the designated timeout window. This type of error usually happens due to one or more of the following reasons:
- Transient network fluctuations
- Increased server load
- Timeout thresholds being exceeded — the connection took too long to establish or complete and was therefore cut off

#### How can I solve a 580 error?
580 errors are **typically temporary**, and their occurrence rate is usually statistically negligible. In most cases, no action is required. However, if you observe a significant or persistent increase in 580 errors, please contact our [Support Team](/kb/platform/support-portal/how-to-submit-case). Be sure to include the **relevant error logs** so our team can investigate and assist you further.
