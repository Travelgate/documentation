# Amend Remarks

The Amend Dates operation enables you to change the booking's remarks. To make a modification to your booking accurately, you should begin by executing the 'quote amend' query to confirm the feasibility of the change and its associated price. After obtaining this information, you can proceed to implement the amendment using the 'commit' mutation, which will finalize the modification in the Seller's system.

## Quote Amend Remarks

The quote amend query simulates the amendment to confirm the price of the booking modification. The returned fields include:

* `amendFee`
* `amendedBookingDetail`
   * `reference`
   * `holder`
   * `hotel`
   * `price`
   * `quotePrice`
   * `cancelPolicy`
   * `remarks`
   * `status`

### Inputs

When creating your quote amend query, you have two different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings

<CautionSettingsHotelX />

### 1. Criteria 

You can perform the `query` (simulation) of the amendment sending all the booking information (`reference`, `dates`, `hotelcode`) or sending the `bookingID` got in the booking flow:

* Booking information:
   * `accessCode`
   * `language`
   * `hotelCode`
   * `reference`
   * `dates`

* BookingID got in the booking flow:
   * `bookingID`

You can decide between the two options either by booking information or directly by `bookingID`, empowering you with the choice that suits you best.

Additionally you'll need to indicate the new remark you want to include in your reservation with the `remarks` input. For example:


```js
{
    "criteria" : {
        "bookingID" : "n1@1[241128[241129[240516[1[es[EUR[2[test_09052024_test[3128791[",
        "remarks" : "Non-smoking room, Connecting rooms"
    }
}
```



### 2. Settings 

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. By default, we apply the same configuration to all Hotel-X clients.

**Mandatory Settings:**
* `client`
* `context`
* `timeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for the supplier connection. Won't close client connection if exceeded.)

**Optional Settings:**
* `group`
* `auditTransactions`
* `suppliers` (Each one contains its own code, settings and accesses)
* `plugins`
* `testMode` (This flag allows only the accesses checked as test)
* `clientTokens` (Used to identify the origin of the request, this is only used in plugins)
* `businessRules`


:::caution Remember
Keep in mind that if you leave some of the fields in the `settings` inputs unspecified, we will use the values from your default settings. You can review and control your default API settings by visiting the [API Settings section](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/settings) on our website.
