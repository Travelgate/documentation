# Hotel-X Certification

### When to Apply
You should apply once you've completed implementing the relevant methods.

### What Information Will We Check?
The certification aims to verify that the Hotel-X API user makes requests correctly. This is done by reviewing request and response logs for the following methods:
1. Content: Hotels Query request and response.
2. Booking Flow:
   1. Search Query request and response.
   2. Quote Query request and response.
   3. Book Mutation request and response.
3. Booking Management: Cancellation Mutation request and response.

For the Booking Flow, we have three possible cases:
1. C1: Refundable Option.
2. C2: Non-Refundable Option.
3. C3: Direct Payment Option.

Travelgate has implemented an automated certification system to ensure the key points of the methods are correctly covered according to the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API. This system requires the certification files to be **uploaded in a specific name and format**: the format should be “.json”and the name should indicate the corresponding certification.

The following table outlines the names corresponding to each part of the certification process:

| Method                       | Request                  | Response              |

}
```

### Is It Necessary to Complete All Certification Cases?
No, it's only necessary to complete the cases that will be used by the user. However, Case 1 (Refundable Option) is always mandatory.

### What Credentials and Connections Should I Use for Certification?
It is recommended to always use the [demo connections provided](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/getting-started-with-hotel-x-buyers-api/hotel-x-credentials#access%EF%B8%8F) (Travelgate test and Smyrooms test) along with your client and API Key.

### Which Hotels Can I Use for Certification Cases?
For certification cases, you can use the following hotels:
- Hotels 1, 2, and 23 for Travelgate test supplier.
- Hotel 27 for Smyrooms test supplier.

Those hotels are recommended, but remember that any hotel showing availability in Travelgate and Smyrooms test suppliers is valid.
