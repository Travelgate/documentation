# Error BD

### What Does an "Error BD" Mean?

An **"Error BD"** typically occurs when a user attempts to add two master rooms with identical codes in the Inventory Extranet, creating a conflict when adding a new room to a hotel. The error is also related to the message: **"An item with the same key has already been added,"** which may appear when editing a room that has already been duplicated.

### How to Prevent 'Error BD' in the Inventory Extranet

To prevent database errors:
    - **Do not duplicate room codes** under any circumstances.
    - **Avoid multiple tabs:** When setting up a hotel, **work in a single browser tab**.
    - **Coordinate with team members:**
        - Assign different properties or sections to each person.
        - Prevent overlapping actions that can trigger database conflicts.
