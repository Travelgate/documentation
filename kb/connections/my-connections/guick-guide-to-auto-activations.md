# Quick guide to auto-connections

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of requesting a connection with one of our Partners via the TravelgateX Marketplace. We aim to make this journey as straightforward and seamless as possible, ensuring you can easily connect with your chosen partners and enhance your business opportunities. We had, and still have, only one objective: to make connecting a Partner easier and faster. 

:::info Keep in mind
It's worth noting that having a commercial contract with TravelgateX is a must to request a new connection. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to our friendly Sales Team at sales.support@travelgate.com.

## **How can I request a new connection?**

1. Log onto [TravelgateX](https://www.travelgatex.com/).

2. Head over to the "Connections" > "My connections" section. Before you begin, double-check that you're logged into the correct Organization and Partner profile type (Buyer or Seller). If you're unsure, you can find this information in the top right corner of your screen.

3. Click on "Create a new connection" and let's get started with the steps for a smooth connection process.
    * **Step 1 (Partner):** Choose the Partner you want to connect with. Some Sellers may offer multiple connection types ([Pull or Push](/kb/getting-started-with-travelgate/About-our-Connectivity/what-is-the-difference-between-pull-and-push-sellers)), so pick the one that suits you best.

    * **Step 2 (Access configuration):** Let's dive into configuring your access with the Partner! Firstly, assign a distinctive name to your access, perhaps indicating whether it's intended for B2B or B2C operations. Next, specify whether it's for testing purposes or if it's ready to go live. Then, complete the form with the credentials provided by the Seller. Keep in mind that each Seller may require different information based on their system's specifications. It's important to note that activating your access with credentials that haven't been greenlit by the Seller can disrupt the workflow and cause delays. Therefore, ensure that your credentials are active and fully operational before proceeding.

    * **Step 3 (Notification setup):** Let us know where you'd like to receive notifications once the activation is created and access is granted.

    * **Step 4 (Review and confirm):**  Double-check all the provided information and confirm to kick off the auto-activation process. Once complete, we'll send you an email containing all the necessary information to set the connection live. Additionally, you can monitor the information and activation status from the "My Connection" section for your convenience. Easy peasy!

We're constantly improving our Activation Process to make it smoother for you. While much of the data is auto-completed, you'll still need to configure some details for each new connection. Ensuring the accuracy of these details will help speed up the process. Keep those specifics precise, and you'll breeze through the setup! 🚀

## Auto-connection Status

Once you've requested a new connection with your partner, you can track its progress in the 'My Connections' section. Here's what each status means:

| Status                    | Description        |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 🟢 Working                | Your access is all set!   |
| 🟡 Pending                | Our automatic process is still setting things up, but it'll be ready soon. Once it is, it'll switch to 'Working' automatically.   |
| 🟡 Pending Seller         | We're waiting on final details from either the seller or buyer to keep things moving smoothly. Sometimes we need a bit more info, like search criteria, to ensure the process passes our test.   |
| 🔴 Not Working            | Uh-oh, something didn't quite go as planned. Our team will step in to sort it out manually, and we'll reach out to you with updates soon.   |
