# Mapping

Welcome to the "Mapping" section in Travelgate's Marketplace! This tool is designed to help Sellers easily validate or invalidate the mapping between their portfolio's hotels and boards and Travelgate's master database. With this feature, you can ensure your data aligns perfectly with Travelgate's system.

### How it works? 📊

In API Settings, you have the power to view and tweak your Hotel-X Pull Buyers API account settings effortlessly. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

1. Begin by logging into [our Platform](https://www.travelgate.com/).

2. Navigate to the "Connections" > "Mapping" section.

3. Start by selecting the supplier from your organization whose mappings you want to review. It’s as simple as a few clicks!

4. Once you’ve chosen a supplier, you’ll see a table displaying paired hotel data (or board in case you select the board tab):
	* Top Row: Details from Travelgate's master hotel database, including:
		* * Hotel Code
		* * Hotel Name
		* * Country
		* * Address
		* * Geolocation	
	* Bottom Row: The matching details from the selected supplier’s portfolio, showing the same information as above.
	* Extra Info: Each pairing also includes the number of bookings for that hotel with the supplier since February 2023.

5. You decide if the pairing is correct:

	* **Validate**: Confirms that the supplier's hotel matches the Travelgate master hotel.

	* **Invalidate**: Indicates that the supplier's hotel doesn’t match the Travelgate master hotel.


Choose how you want to handle pairings:

- **Individually:** Click the "Validate" or "Invalidate" button for each pairing.
- **In Bulk:** Select multiple pairings using the checkboxes on the left side of the table, then use the "Validate" or "Invalidate" buttons at the top. This process is as intuitive as managing emails in Gmail.


### Filters and Search 🔎

Use the left-hand sidebar to quickly find what you’re looking for with these options:

- **By Status:** Filter pairings by validated or invalidated.
- **By Name or Code:** Search for specific hotels or boards.
- **By Country:** Narrow down pairings by country.

### Export to CSV 📄

Want to keep a record? Use the **"Download CSV"** option to export data from the Mapping section. The file will include both Travelgate’s master data and your supplier’s portfolio. If you’ve applied any filters, only the filtered pairings will be downloaded.
