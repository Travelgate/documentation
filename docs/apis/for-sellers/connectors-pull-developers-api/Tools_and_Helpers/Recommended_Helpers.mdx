# Recommended Helpers

To facilitate complex points in the Connector, the `IConnectorsUtilities` class provides several helpful utilities. These helpers simplify common tasks and ensure adherence to Travelgate standards.

---

## **Utilities Overview**

### **IOptionsFromRoomsGenerator**
This utility is particularly useful in the `Search` operation for suppliers that return rooms instead of pre-made options. Since Travelgate operates with options, this generator accumulates rooms and applies business rules to generate valid options.

> **Use Case**: Recommended when the supplier provides rooms without combining them into options.

```csharp
public interface IOptionsFromRoomsGenerator
{
  bool TryAddHotelRoom(
    string hotelCode,           // Unique identifier of the hotel the room belongs to
    string boardCode,           // Code representing the room's board type (e.g. AI)
    RoomCombineExtended roomCombineExtended, // Contains detailed info about the room and combination logic
    int combinationKey,         // Key used to handle room combinations (optional in overloads). 
                                // If specified, only items with the same key will be combined
    Location location = null,   // Optional: info about the hotel's location (e.g. city, coordinates)
    string hotelName = null,    // Optional: name of the hotel
    string boardName = null     // Optional: name of the board type (e.g. "All Inclusive")
  );
}

//Real example of how can it be used (injected):

var roomCombineExtended = MethodThatReturnsARoomCombineExtended(supplierRoomData);
var location = MethodThatReturnsALocation(supplierLocationData);

_optionsFromRoomsGenerator.TryAddHotelRoom(
                    supplier.HotelCode,
                    supplier.BoardCode,
                    roomCombineExtended,
                    0
                    location,
                    supplier.HotelName,
                    supplier.BoardName);

List<Accommodation> accomodationList = _optionsFromRoomsGenerator.Combine();
```

### **IOptionsGenerator**
Similar to `IOptionsFromRoomsGenerator`, this utility accumulates pre-made options provided by the supplier. It applies Travelgate's business rules to ensure compliance with Travelgate standards.

> **Use Case**: Recommended when the supplier already provides pre-made options in the response.

```csharp
public interface IOptionsGenerator
{
  bool TryAddHotelOption(
    string hotelCode,           // Unique identifier of the hotel the room belongs to
    string boardCode,           // Code representing the room's board type (e.g. AI)
    Option option,              // Contains detailed info about the room and combination logic
    string hotelName = null,    // Optional: name of the hotel
    string boardName = null     // Optional: name of the board type (e.g. "All Inclusive")
  );
}

//Real example of how can it be used (injected):

var option = MethodThatReturnsAnOption(supplierOptionData);

_optionsGenerator.TryAddHotelOption(
                    supplier.HotelCode,
                    supplier.BoardCode,
                    option,
                    supplier.HotelName,
                    supplier.BoardName);

List<Accommodation> accomodationList = _optionsGenerator.Combine();

```

### **ICountryConverter**
Converts ISO country codes and names, facilitating compatibility between supplier-specific formats and standardized ISO formats.

> **Use Case**: Useful in `Search` or `Book` operations where supplier-specific country formats need to align with Travelgate standards.

[TODO inject code of `ICountryConverter`]

### **IMetadataConnectorsService**
Provides access to metadata utilities, allowing retrieval of supplier metadata, business rule configurations, and other operational data required for processing requests.

> **Use Case**: Ideal for dynamic retrieval and use of metadata, enabling adaptable and consistent Connector operations.

These helpers are recommended for ensuring that your Connector adheres to Travelgate's standards and simplifies the handling of complex operations.
