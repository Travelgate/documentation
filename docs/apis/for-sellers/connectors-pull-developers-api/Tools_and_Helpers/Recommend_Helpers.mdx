# Recommend Helpers

To facilitate complex points in the Connector, the `IConnectorsUtilities` class provides several helpful utilities. These helpers simplify common tasks and ensure adherence to Travelgate standards.

---

## **Utilities Overview**

### **IOptionsFromRoomsGenerator**
This utility is particularly useful in the `Search` operation for suppliers that return rooms instead of pre-made options. Since Travelgate operates with options, this generator accumulates rooms and applies business rules to generate valid options.

> **Use Case**: Recommended when the supplier provides rooms without combining them into options.

```csharp
public interface IOptionsFromRoomsGenerator
{
  bool TryAddHotelRoom(
    string hotelCode,           // Unique identifier of the hotel the room belongs to
    string boardCode,           // Code representing the room's board type (e.g. AI)
    RoomCombineExtended roomCombineExtended, // Contains detailed info about the room and combination logic
    int combinationKey,         // Key used to handle room combinations (optional in overloads). 
                                // If specified, only items with the same key will be combined
    Location location = null,   // Optional: info about the hotel's location (e.g. city, coordinates)
    string hotelName = null,    // Optional: name of the hotel
    string boardName = null     // Optional: name of the board type (e.g. "All Inclusive")
  );
}

//Real example of how can it be used (injected):

var roomCombineExtended = MethodThatReturnsARoomCombineExtended(supplierRoomData)
var location = MethodThatReturnsALocation(supplierLocationData)

_optionsFromRoomsGenerator.TryAddHotelRoom(
                    supplier.HotelCode,
                    supplier.BoardCode,
                    roomCombineExtended,
                    0
                    location,
                    supplier.HotelName,
                    supplier.BoardName);
```

---

### **IOptionsGenerator**
Similar to `IOptionsFromRoomsGenerator`, this utility accumulates pre-made options provided by the supplier. It applies Travelgate's business rules to ensure compliance with Travelgate standards.

> **Use Case**: Recommended when the supplier already provides pre-made options in the response.

```csharp
public interface IOptionsGenerator
{
  bool TryAddHotelOption(
    string hotelCode,           // Unique identifier of the hotel the room belongs to
    string boardCode,           // Code representing the room's board type (e.g. AI)
    Option option,              // Contains detailed info about the room and combination logic
    string hotelName = null,    // Optional: name of the hotel
    string boardName = null     // Optional: name of the board type (e.g. "All Inclusive")
  );
}

//Real example of how can it be used (injected):

var option = MethodThatReturnsAnOption(supplierOptionData)

_optionsGenerator.TryAddHotelOption(
                    supplier.HotelCode,
                    supplier.BoardCode,
                    option,
                    supplier.HotelName,
                    supplier.BoardName);
```

### **ICancelPenaltyManager**
Handles the transformation and management of supplier cancellation policies, ensuring compatibility with the standardized Travelgate format.

> **Use Case**: Essential for operations like `Quote` or `Cancel` to standardize cancellation policies provided by the supplier.

[TODO inject code of `ICancelPenaltyManager`]

---

### **ICountryConverter**
Converts ISO country codes and names, facilitating compatibility between supplier-specific formats and standardized ISO formats.

> **Use Case**: Useful in `Search` or `Book` operations where supplier-specific country formats need to align with Travelgate standards.

[TODO inject code of `ICountryConverter`]

---

### **IMetadataConnectorsService**
Provides access to metadata utilities, allowing retrieval of supplier metadata, business rule configurations, and other operational data required for processing requests.

> **Use Case**: Ideal for dynamic retrieval and use of metadata, enabling adaptable and consistent Connector operations.

[TODO inject code of `IMetadataConnectorsService`]

These helpers are recommended for ensuring that your Connector adheres to Travelgate's standards and simplifies the handling of complex operations.
