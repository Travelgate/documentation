# Connect to Channel Managers via Travelgate

### What to Expect When Connecting to a Channel Manager 

- **As a Buyer**, you can use our Inventory Extranet to create the setup and structure for hotels, rates, and rooms contracted with the Channel Manager/Hotels. The setup should align with the agreements made with each hotel. Additionally, you will have the ability to access and book inventory via our API.
- **The Channel Manager** will extract the codes for hotels, rates, and rooms created and map them to their data, enabling them to load availability and rates into our system.

### Activation and Configuration

Travelgate allows only **one credential (Hotel-X Access Code) per Channel Manager**. If you require multiple configurations, the Inventory Extranet offers flexible setup options to tailor your product settings efficiently.

### How to Connect to a Channel Manager 

1. **Log into Our Platform:** Note that to connect to a Channel Manager, you must be a registered Buyer on Travelgate.

2. **Explore Available Channel Managers:** Visit our [Network](https://app.travelgate.com/network/partners) and select the "Tech Platform > Channel Manager" category to view available options.

3. **Confirm Commercial Agreements:** Coordinate with both the hotel and the Channel Manager to finalize commercial agreements. Be sure to inform them that the connection will be made via Travelgate.

4. **Request Activation:** Submit your activation request through our Platform under "My Connections." A complete guide on how to request activation can be found [here](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).

5. **Credentials Generation:** Once your request is processed, we will generate credentials for accessing the Inventory Extranet and finalize the activation with the Channel Manager.

6. **Access and Configuration:** Once activation is complete, we will provide the necessary access credentials and configuration settings to connect via API and use the Inventory Extranet.

7. **Learn with Travelgate Resources:** After gaining access, enhance your knowledge by watching [Travelgate Academy videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_nJoDkMOTA) and reviewing our [Extranet Documentation](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/overview) to get familiar with available features.

8. **Create a Pilot Hotel:** Set up a pilot hotel to conduct product loading tests. Refer to the "Setup" section in our [Documentation](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/overview) for step-by-step guidance. We recommend using an actual hotel you plan to work with, making it easier to transition to the live phase.
