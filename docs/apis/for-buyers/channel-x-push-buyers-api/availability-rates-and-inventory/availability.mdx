    <summary>What does LengthsOfStay ArrivalDateBased mean? What’s different between the true and false values?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>If ArrivalDateBase is set to true, it checks whether the Min and Max LengthsOfStay conditions are met on the check-in day. If ArrivalDateBase is set to false, it checks if the Min and Max LengthsOfStay conditions are met for all the days you are requesting, meaning it ensures that these conditions are met for each day of your stay.</div>
