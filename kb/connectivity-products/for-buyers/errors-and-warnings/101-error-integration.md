# 101 Error - System Exception

## What Does a 101 Error Mean? 
A **101 error** (system exception) occurs when we do not receive a specific tag or field expected while parsing the supplier's response. Additionally, this error may appear if the Buyer omits required fields in their request.

## How to Resolve a 101 Error 
1. **Verify Required Fields** – Ensure that all mandatory fields for the specific operation are included in your request.
2. **Seek Assistance** – If the issue persists, contact our [Customer Support Team](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for further guidance.
