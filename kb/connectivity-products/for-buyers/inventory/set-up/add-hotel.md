## Adding a Hotel to Your Inventory Setup

The **Inventory system** operates with a **master hotel database**, where we store all basic hotel information configured by our partners. To add a new hotel to your setup, follow these steps:

1. **Access** the Inventory Extranet.
2. **Navigate** to **Inventory > SetUp** (top menu).
3. **Click** on **+Add Hotel** and enter the hotel name in the **Autocomplete** field. The system will display all matching properties.

4. **Select** the desired property. The hotel will only appear as a suggestion in the autocomplete field if it is not already added to the client-provider relationship.
