# Currencies at Travelgate

## How Can I Check the Currencies Supported by a Seller?
To find out which currencies a Seller supports, you can use our [Metadata Query](/kb/connectivity-products/for-buyers/hotel-x/content/metadata) method or contact the Seller directly.

## Handling Unsupported Currencies
If a Seller does not support the currency specified in the Search request, one of two things may happen:
1. The Seller returns an error indicating that the requested currency is not supported.
2. The Seller responds with the default currency configured on their end for your credentials.
