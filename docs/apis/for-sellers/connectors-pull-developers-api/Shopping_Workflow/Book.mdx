## **Overview**

The `Book` operation is the final step in the booking workflow, used to confirm a reservation for a selected option. It involves providing detailed guest information, payment details (if required), and a client locator. Once completed, the supplier processes the reservation and returns its status.

## **Purpose**
The `Book` operation ensures:
- **Guest Information Submission**: Transfers passenger details, including names, surnames, and any additional guest-specific data, to the supplier.
- **Payment Validation**: Confirms and processes payment if the supplier requires it at the booking stage.
- **Reservation Confirmation**: Secures the selected option and generates a unique supplier locator for future management (e.g., cancellation or check bookings).

## **When to Use**
- **Finalizing Reservations**: After `Quote`, when the selected option has been validated and confirmed.
- **Session-Based Suppliers**: For suppliers requiring additional validation or token updates during the booking process.
- **Immediate Confirmation**: For suppliers offering instant booking confirmation.

> **Note**: If the booking status is returned as `Unknown`, the client must handle further investigation or contact the supplier to confirm the booking.

## **Response Details**
The `Book` operation returns:
- **Booking Status**:
  - `Confirmed`: The booking has been successfully processed.
  - `Unknown`: The supplier could not finalize the booking. Further action may be required.
- **Supplier Locator**: A unique identifier for the booking from the supplier, used for future operations like cancellation or check bookings.
- **Additional Details**: May include booking remarks or warnings specific to the supplier.

## **Common Scenarios**
- **Payment-Required Suppliers**: Includes credit card information or other payment details as part of the `Book` request.
- **Error Handling**: Common errors include:
  - `SupplierBookingNotConfirmed`: Indicates that the booking could not be processed by the supplier.
  - `ItemNotAvailable`: Returned if the selected option is no longer valid at the time of booking.

## **Technical Details**
- **Request Object**:
  - Includes passenger details, payment information, client locator, and the selected option.
