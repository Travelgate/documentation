# 105 error - Communication Error

### What does a 105 error mean?💡
The 105 error is returned whenever the connection to the Seller has been refused (we haven't been able to connect to their system).

### What can I do if I receive a 105 error in my response?✔️
1. If you suddenly encounter these errors, you should **verify the URLs** in your accesses/configurations and make sure they match the information stored for those credentials in [My Connections](/kb/connections/my-connections/).
1. If your URLs are correct, we recommend you **contact the Seller** in order to determine if they are encountering any issues on their end (such as server crashes).
2. Should you need further support after checking this information with the Seller, do not hesitate to contact us through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support) in our Portal and our team will be happy to help.

**If a Seller's system filters by IP**, they should ensure that all TravelgateX IP addresses are whitelisted on their end to prevent errors. They can check our list of IPs [here](/kb/getting-started-with-travelgate/about-our-connectivity/how-do-tgx-ips-work-with-sellers).
