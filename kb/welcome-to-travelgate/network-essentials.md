# About Our Network

### Expand Your Business Connections with Our Network

At Travelgate, we provide personalized recommendations for new connections based on your activity within our Marketplace. Our advanced algorithms help you **grow your network** and boost your booking volume by connecting you with Partners that align with your trading patterns.

### How Does Travelgate's Partner Recommendation Work?

Our suggested connections are carefully curated **based on your performance** and data-driven insights. InsightsX analyzes your data and cross-references it with global data stored on our platform. This ensures that Partners matching your business criteria (listed below) appear as "Recommended" connections:

* **Your Destinations**: Increase sales in your key destinations.
* **Your Markets**: Expand your reach in existing selling markets.

Looking to expand further?

* **New Destinations**: Enter new travel destinations.
* **New Markets**: Explore untapped selling markets.

### Where Can I Find Recommendations for My Company?

You can access your recommended connections via your [Dashboard](https://app.travelgate.com/dashboard) and the [Network's Partner List](https://app.travelgate.com/network/partners). Once you find a Partner you're interested in, simply arrange your own contract and request their activation. It’s that easy!
