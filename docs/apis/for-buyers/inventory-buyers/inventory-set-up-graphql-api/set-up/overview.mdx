# Overview

Our collection of Set Up GraphQL methods is designed to offer you flexibility and control, allowing you to tailor your inventory to meet specific market demands and customer preferences. Each section of this guide provides detailed insights into different aspects of Inventory product management:

Throughout this section you will find the following common fields: 
* `clientCode`: It is your unique identifier as a Buyer in Inventory. It can be retrieved from any TravelgateX access with a Channel Manager. See My Connections and click "Get form data" in the selected access. The code in `Password` is your `ClientCode`.
* `supplierCode`: It is the unique identifier of a Channel Manager in Inventory. It is the `User` in the TravelgateX access.
* `hotelCode`: It is the code of a hotel in Inventory. It can be equivalent to the `hotelId` generated by our system or it can be the native hotel code from the Channel Manager.
* `contextCode`: It is the Inventory Context linked to a hotel. It is required in case the hotel is from a specific Channel Manager, otherwise, it can be ommited or filled with "TGX_PUSH".

:::note

The possible values for `contextCode` can be retrieved using the query [Inventory Contexts](../static-data/inventory-contexts).
