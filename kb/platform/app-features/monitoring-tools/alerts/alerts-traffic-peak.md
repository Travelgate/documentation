## Use Cases of Traffic Peak Alerts

### 1. Alert When Traffic Increases or Decreases by a Specific Percentage Over a Given Timeframe

**Example:** "Check if, in the last hour, traffic has decreased by 20% compared to the previous hour. The alert should check conditions every 2 hours."
    - **Time Window:** Period over which the alert evaluates data (e.g., 60 minutes).
    - **Variation:** Comparison type (Increase, Decrease, or Both). In this example: Increase.
    - **Deviation %:** Minimum threshold for triggering an alert (e.g., 20%).
    - **Comparison Window:** Defines the reference period (Last Period, Yesterday, or Last Week). In this example: Last Period.
    - **Frequency:** How often the alert checks conditions:
        1 hour → Evaluates traffic every hour.
        2 hours → Evaluates traffic every 2 hours.

- **Traffic Volume:** Threshold for triggering an alert (e.g., 1,000 transactions).
- **Time Window:** Period over which data is analyzed (e.g., 60 minutes).
