# Why should I develop Hotel Push Sellers API?

:::danger deprecated API
The Hotel Push Sellers API was our first Sellers API, launched back in 2012. It is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Since then, we have launched a new Push Sellers API, in which Travelgate currently plays a proactive role in [developing API integrations](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-seller/getting-started-as-a-new-seller/seller-api-development-roadmap) on behalf of the Seller.
