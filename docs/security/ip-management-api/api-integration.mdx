# API Integration

Our IP Management API gives you read-only access to your service infrastructure. With just a few GraphQL queries, you can fetch detailed information about IP addresses, their ranges, and the services theyâ€™re associated with.

This guide will help you integrate our API into your systems to query IP-related data with precision and speed.

## Before You Start

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* **Basic GraphQL Knowledge**: The API uses GraphQL, so familiarity with queries and schema-based responses will be helpful.
* **Access to the API Endpoint**: Ensure your system can make HTTP requests to our GraphQL endpoint.
* **API Key**: Authentication is required for every request to the Travelgate GraphQL API. An API Key must be included in the HTTP Authorization request header to authenticate the user agent with the server. You can find your list of API Keys (encrypted) and create new ones on the Travelgate website in [API Keys](https://app.travelgate.com/settings/apikeys).

  ```html
  Authorization: ApiKey xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```     

## General Information

* **API Endpoint**:

  ```
  https://api.travelgate.com
  ```

* **Access Type**: Read-only (no mutations supported)  
* **Primary Scope**: Fetch IP addresses, ranges, and associated service metadata  

## Query: Fetch All Services

Retrieve all available services with optional details on associated IP addresses and their statuses.

**Query Example**:

```graphql
{
  infraestructure {
    allServices {
      id
      name
      description
      createdAt
      ipAddresses {
        ipAddress
        rangeStart
        rangeEnd
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "infraestructure": {
      "allServices": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "name": "ChannelX",
          "description": "IP addresses for ChannelX services",
          "createdAt": "2024-10-10T10:15:00",
          "ipAddresses": [
            {
              "ipAddress": "13.94.250.159/32",
              "rangeStart": "13.94.250.159",
              "rangeEnd": "13.94.250.159",
              "status": "active"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Fetch All IP Addresses

Retrieve all IP addresses or ranges with associated services and their statuses.

**Query Example**:

```graphql
{
  infraestructure {
    allIpAddresses {
      ipAddress
      rangeStart
      rangeEnd
      services {
        id
        name
        description
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "infraestructure": {
      "allIpAddresses": [
        {
          "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1/32",
          "rangeStart": "192.168.1.1",
          "rangeEnd": "192.168.1.1",

              "status": "active"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Fetch a Specific Service by ID

Retrieve detailed information about a specific service and its associated IPs.

**Query Example**:

```graphql
{
  infraestructure {
    serviceByID(id: "2") {
      id
      name
      description
      createdAt
      ipAddresses {
        ipAddress
        rangeStart
        rangeEnd
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:

```json

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Fetch IP Address by Specific Address

Fetch details of a specific IP address or check if an IP falls within a defined range.

**Query Example**:

```graphql
{
  infraestructure {
    ipByAddress(address: "52.148.208.57") {
      ipAddress
      rangeStart
      rangeEnd
      services {
        id

        description
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "infraestructure": {
            "ipByAddress": {
                "ipAddress": "52.148.208.57/32",
                "rangeStart": "52.148.208.57",
                "rangeEnd": "52.148.208.57",
                "services": [
                    {
                        "id": "3",

            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Fetch IP Address by Range

Query for an IP address by providing an IP within a range.

**Query Example**:

```graphql
{
  infraestructure {
    ipByAddress(address: "216.59.61.160") {
      ipAddress
      rangeStart
      rangeEnd
      services {
        id
        name
        description
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "infraestructure": {
            "ipByAddress": {
                "ipAddress": "216.59.61.160/27",
                "rangeStart": "216.59.61.160",
                "rangeEnd": "216.59.61.191",
                "services": [
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "name": "Hotel Suppliers",
                        "description": "Service Hotel Suppliers",
                        "status": "active"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid IP Address

If an invalid IP address is passed, the API will return an error message.

**Example**:

```graphql
{
  infraestructure {
    ipByAddress(address: "999.999.999.999") {
      ipAddress
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "'999.999.999.999' is not a valid IP address.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

## Additional Details

- **IP Address Fields**:
  - `ipAddress`: Holds a single IP address (or null if it's a range).
  - `rangeStart`, `rangeEnd`: Used to define the start and end of an IP range.
  - `status`: Indicates whether the IP is `active` or `inactive`.

- **Service Fields**:
  - `id`: The unique identifier of the service.
  - `name`: The name of the service.
  - `description`: A brief description of the service.

## Conclusion

This API allows querying both individual IPs and IP ranges, with detailed relationships to services. 
It ensures robust validation of inputs and provides detailed responses, including the status and timestamps of IP addresses.
