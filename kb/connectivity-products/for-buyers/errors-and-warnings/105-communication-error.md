# 105 Error - Communication Error

## What Does a 105 Error Mean?
A **105 error** occurs when the connection to the Seller is refused, meaning Travelgate was unable to establish a connection with their system.

## How to Handle a 105 Error

#### 1. **Verify Your URLs**
If you suddenly start receiving these errors, check that the URLs in your access configurations match the credentials stored in [My Connections](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/managing-connections/connections-details).

#### 2. **Contact the Seller**
If your URLs are correct, reach out to the Seller to confirm whether they are experiencing any technical issues (e.g., server downtime or system crashes).

#### 3. **Request Additional Support**
If the issue persists after verifying the URLs and contacting the Seller, reach out to us through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support). Our team will be happy to assist you.

**If a Seller’s system filters by IP**, they should ensure that all Travelgate IP addresses are whitelisted to avoid connectivity errors. The list of Travelgate IPs can be found [here](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/connectivity-services/how-do-tgx-ips-work-with-sellers).
