# Content Discrepancies

### Why am I not receiving the content expected from a Seller?🔎
This can occur for the following reasons:

1. Your content has not been updated yet. Find more information on how to review and manage your content using our APP [here](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content.md).
2. If you encounter 0 hotels ('There is no data to display') in the My Connections Content section, you should manually force a content update for that access through the [“Force Content Now”](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality) tool. Remember, if you've reactivated an access that was previously deactivated, it will always show 0 properties until the next scheduled automatic update occurs or until you manually force the update through the "Force Content Now" functionality. Content updates are only carried out for [active accesses](/kb/connections/my-connections/#what-can-i-find-in-my-connections) on our platform.
3. The Seller has not provided certain mandatory fields, resulting in the exclusion of some items (e.g., hotels, destinations).
4. The Seller has not sent those particular items.

### What can I do to manage this discrepancy?🚀
1. Reach out to the Seller to ensure they are sending the missing information, including all the required fields expected at an integration level.
2. If the issue persists, you may [force an update of your content](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality).
3. If the problem continues even after forcing an update of your content, please [open a Case](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) to our Customer Support Team for further investigation.

### What can I do if I receive an error while downloading my content?💡
1. Make sure the credentials in your request (Hotel-X Access Code or Legacy Configuration) are active and operative.
2. Check our [list of errors and warnings](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/lists-of-errors-and-warnings/overview) for further information. 
3. If you encounter an error while downloading your content, we recommend [forcing an update](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality). Once it's complete, restart the download process.
4. If the issue persists or the error code received is not listed, please open a Case through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) for further investigation.

:::info Force Content Updates
When conducting a 'Force content now' update to refresh a Seller's portfolio, note that the duration of the update depends on the **size of the content**. The update is managed through a **queue system** and will proceed when it reaches its turn (this could take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, or potentially even a day). If the update has not completed after this time, you may initiate the force update again if necessary.

Besides, keep in mind that if you force an update for a large set of accesses, such as updating all accesses for a Supplier across all Buyers, will result in a longer queue, thereby increasing the overall update duration.

In cases where you've followed the steps above and still do not have the most up-to-date content, please don't hesitate to reach out through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team) for further help. We're here to ensure you have the best possible experience!
