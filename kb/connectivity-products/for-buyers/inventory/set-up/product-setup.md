# Product Setup

## Setting Up Your Product in Inventory

Follow these steps to configure your product in the **Travelgate Inventory** system:

1. Log into [Travelgate](https://www.travelgate.com/).
2. Navigate to **Solutions > Inventory**.
3. Click on **Inventory > SetUp**.
4. [Configure the Setup](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup/) for your contracted hotels.
5. Once the setup is complete, the Channel Manager will be able to retrieve all the information and map it to begin loading allotment and prices.  
To prevent mapping issues by the Channel, please ensure your portfolio is up to date and includes all the hotels the Channel Manager plans to map before they retrieve your setup information. You can update your static content at any time by going to the Connections > Content section and clicking the ["Force Update Now"](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/connections-content/content-management) button.

### Retrieving a Hotel's Destination Code
- To obtain the destination code of a specific hotel in your Inventory SetUp, run a **Hotel-X Hotels query** and check the response for the closestDestination field. For the Legacy Pull Buyers API, use the **Descriptive Info method** and look for the GeographicDestination node.
- To retrieve the full list of destinations at the connection level, run a **Hotel-X Destinations query** and locate the relevant field in the response. For the Legacy Pull Buyers API, use the **Geographic Destination Tree method** and follow the same approach.

    :::info
    For details on destination-related fields in each query or method, please refer to the [Hotel-X](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/content/overview) and [Legacy Pull Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/deprecated/legacy-pull-buyers-api/content/overview) documentation.

## Room Combination & Booking Limits

### Room Combinations

Rooms with the same code are treated as the same room, regardless of associated rates. **It is not possible to share the allotment**. If the requested room capacity exceeds the available stock, it will be excluded from availability to prevent overbooking.

### Understanding Booking Limits: A Case Example

The **'Booking Limit'** is the maximum number of reservations allowed for a specific room type on a given day.  

For example, if you set a **'Booking Limit'** of **50** for the period from **January 15 to January 30**, it means you can accept up to **50 reservations per day** for that room type.  
- On **Wednesday**, you can have a maximum of **50** reservations.  
- On **Thursday**, you can have a maximum of **50** reservations.  
- On **Friday**, you can have a maximum of **50** reservations, and so on.  

Additionally, you can **remove availability** (by date range) based on conditions such as:  
- **Booking Limit** (allocation)  
- **Minimum or maximum stay duration**  
- **Minimum or maximum length of stay upon arrival**  
- **Minimum or maximum release**  

These limits apply to **each room type individually**, not to the hotel as a whole. If your hotel offers multiple room types, each can have its own **'Booking Limit'**.

## PMS & Channel Manager Integration

- Travelgate does **not** have direct access to a hotel's **PMS (Property Management System)** or the **Channel Managerâ€™s** internal system. If a booking does not appear in the PMS, the hotelier should contact the Channel Manager directly.
- To check the status of your bookings via Travelgate, use the **[Logging Section](/kb/platform/app-features/monitoring-tools/logging/logging-details)**.


## Troubleshooting & Support

### Missing Booking Notifications

1. If you, as **the Client, or the hotel** have not received a booking notification email, follow these steps:

    1. **Check your Extranet setup:** Ensure that the **Hotel Email, CC Address, and From Address** are correctly configured. If needed, [update the information](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup#how-to-add-a-hotel) to ensure notifications reach the right recipients. Keep in mind that changes to the notification email only apply to new reservations; prior bookings will still be sent to the previously set email.
    2. **Check Spam and Trash folders:** Sometimes emails are accidentally filtered. Verify that booking notifications havenâ€™t been blocked or redirected.
    3. **Still not receiving emails?** If the issue persists, contact our **Customer Support Team** via the [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for further assistance.

2. If a **Channel Manager** reports that they are not receiving booking notifications via API, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:
    1. **Verify Activation:** Confirm that the Channel Manager has correctly implemented and activated the booking notification method for your account in their system.
    2. **Check the Notification Endpoint:** Ensure the Channel Manager has provided Travelgate with the correct notification endpoint URL so that our system can deliver reservation data.
    3. **Contact Support if Needed:** If both points are confirmed with the Channel Manager but they are still not receiving booking notifications, contact our [Customer Support Team](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for further assistance.
