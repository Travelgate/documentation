## How can I use the "Force update now" functionality?🚀
In order to force an update of your static content, you should simply follow the steps below:

1. Access "My Connections Content" section (follow the steps above) and filter by access/Seller credentials.

:::info Force Content Updates
When conducting a 'Force content now' update to refresh a Seller's portfolio, note that the duration of the update depends on the **size of the content**. The update is managed through a **queue system** and will proceed when it reaches its turn - This could take anywhere from a few minutes to 24-72 hours. If the update has not completed after this time, you may attempt to force the update again.

Please note that **updates within 72 hours fall within the expected update time frame**, so there is no need to contact the Support Team before this period ends.

Besides, keep in mind that if you force an update for a large set of accesses, such as updating all accesses for a Supplier across all Buyers, will result in **a longer queue**, thereby increasing the overall update duration.

In cases where you've followed the steps above and still do not have the most up-to-date content, please don't hesitate to reach out through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team) for further help. We're here to ensure you have the best possible experience!
