# Boards

The Boards Query allows you to retrieve board information in two ways:  
- The **FastX Board Master**, which returns the complete list of standardized meal plans (boards) used in the Travelgate Marketplace and throughout the booking flow.  
- The **Supplier Board List**, which provides the native board information returned by each connected Seller, including available translations.

The returned fields include:

* `boardCode`
* `text`
* `language`


## Query Overview

When creating your boards query, you have 1 input to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria


### 1. Criteria   

This query offers versatility, with certain fields marked as mandatory (`access`) and others as optional (`boardCodes`). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Boards Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. Consequently, the response will only include information that is highly relevant to you, streamlining the retrieval process and ensuring the data you receive meets your exact requirements.

**Mandatory criteria**
* `access`

**Optional criteria**
* `boardCodes` (Search a specific board type)


### Response Considerations

:::note

The amount of information and content returned might vary between Sellers.

Hotel-X supports all languages, but receiving board descriptions in one or another depends entirely on the languages supported by the Seller.

## Examples

#### Search for the FastX master board list for all your connected suppliers

<GraphqlSample query={boardsQuery} variables={boardsFastXVariables} />


#### Search for the complete board list from a supplier

For example, using access '5647' for Smyrooms Test supplier.

<GraphqlSample query={boardsQuery} variables={boardsVariables} />


#### Search for a specific board list from a supplier

When utilizing the Boards List Query, for more personalized results, filter specific boards based on your interests. For example, to focus solely on the half board inventory of a Seller, add the `boardCodes` field with "2" and "256" (these are the codes this Seller has assigned for the half board from their side) in your criteria. This can provide you with highly targeted and relevant information.
