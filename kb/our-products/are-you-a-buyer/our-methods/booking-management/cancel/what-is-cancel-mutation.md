### How are cancellation costs calculated and displayed?🔢
Depending on the specifications provided by a Seller, cancellation costs can be calculated using three different penalty types. It is important to keep in mind that a booking may have more than one penalty type associated with it.

- **NIGHTS:** It indicates the number of nights to be penalized.
- **PERCENT:** It indicates the percentage to pay based on the option price (possible values between 0 and 100).
- **IMPORT:** It Indicates the exact amount payable.

:::warning important
To ensure seamless billing, **it's important that you handle all cancellations via our API**.  
Should you face any issues, please don't hesitate to get in touch with our [Customer Support team](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for assistance. Additionally, please make sure to cancel any test bookings with Sellers and to check that such bookings are refundable.

### Can I apply any filters to my Hotel-X Cancel Mutation?💡
Unfortunately, there are no filters in the Cancel Mutation.

### Is it possible to retrieve the cancellation costs without canceling the option?🔎
If the Seller provides cancel policies information, you can access it either through Hotel-X Quote Query or Hotel-X Booking Query.

### In a reservation for 2 rooms, if two rooms have the same cancellation policy, should the cancellation penalties be summed up in the node for the option?  
Yes, an option is a combination of rooms. Cancelling the option implies the cancellation of all rooms, and therefore, the charges for all the rooms are incurred.
