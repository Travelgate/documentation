# How to edit a hotel name in the Inventory Extranet

### Manage Hotel Name Changes More Efficiently!

If a hotel changes its name and you need to update it in our Extranet, you can easily manage this on your own by following these steps:

1. Make sure the new name is **exactly the same** as the one provided on the hotel's official website. Just use the hotel name without any extra references such as the hotel chain.
2. Check if your user role is **“Client” or “Client Admin”**. If it’s not, simply reach out to a team member who has these permissions.
3. Submit a Case in our Portal - Section [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support) - to request permissions to modify a hotel name.
4. That’s it! Once our team processes your request, you’ll be able to manage this information directly.
