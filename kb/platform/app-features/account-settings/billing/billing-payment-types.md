# Payment Types

This guide will help you select the billing payment type for your connections on Travelgate.

## Available Billing Payment Types

If both you and your Partner are under the **Commercial Agreement 2023**, you will see the following billing payment types in the [Auto-Activations form](/kb/app-features/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations/):

- **FREE**: No cost for you. Your Partner must confirm the full payment of the connectivity from its side.
- **STD**: Standard booking fee, shared between you and your Partner.
- **SUP**: Standard booking fee and a supplement apply to you, while the connection remains free for your Partner.

Review these options with your Partner and choose the one that fits best.

## Requesting a Payment Type Change

You can request a payment type change by navigating to the **Billing** section in the Platform. Under the **Agreements** tab, find the connection for which you want to change the payment type and submit your request.
