# Overview

The Content methods provide access to essential static information from Sellers, including hotel and destination lists, room types, boards, and more. The main focus of this section is how to obtain the unique **FastX codes**, which are used throughout the booking flow and allow you to interact seamlessly with any Supplier in the Marketplace. 

Additionally, you will learn how to access the static data that each Seller provides individually (hotels, rooms, destinations, etc.). The [`metadata`](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/content/metadata) call is particularly important when connecting with a Seller, as it provides details on restrictions and settings specific to that Supplier—such as release days or other limitations—ensuring smooth and informed integration.
