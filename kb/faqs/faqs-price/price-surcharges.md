# Surcharges

## What Is a Surcharge?
A surcharge is an **additional fee** added to the option price. Sellers may apply surcharges for costs such as city taxes or resort fees when required on their end.

Surcharge details may vary depending on the specific property and the Supplier's individual processes.

## What Information Can Be Obtained from a Surcharge?
You can determine whether surcharges must be paid at the hotel upon arrival or in advance by checking the `chargeTypes` field:

1. **INCLUDE** â€“ The surcharge is mandatory and already included in the option price.
2. **EXCLUDE** â€“ The surcharge is not included in the option price and must be paid separately.
