:::caution
To ensure a successful implementation, candidates should possess the following foundational knowledge and skills:

1. **Good understanding of the Travel Trade business**: This means knowing how hotels, sellers, and buyers work together, and how they usually deal with their partners.
2. **Experience with C# programming**: You should be comfortable using C#, since it's the main language used in development. It's also important to understand basic software testing (like unit tests and integration tests).
3. **Knowledge of Travelgate's Data Model**: You need to understand how Travelgate organizes data about options, rooms, boards, and policies (see [Travelgate’s Business Model](/docs/get-started/travelgate-business-model)). This helps connect everything properly with the Seller’s API.
4. **Signed NDA**: A signed Non-Disclosure Agreement is required before we can proceed with any development or share sensitive information.

To begin developing a connector, ensure the following are in place:

- Seller's API documentation should be analized and approved by Travelgate (see the template that we'll be using: [template](./documentation.mdx)).
- You must have a GitHub account, as Travelgate will assign the license to it.
- Download the template (both Shopping and Content templates). Travelgate will provide you with them.
- Join the Discord channel—Travelgate will share the link with you.

Tools you may need:

- **FormTest**: An useful Travelgate tool that will allow you to make requests directly to the Connector. For more details, check [FormTest Documentation](../tools-and-helpers/formtest-documentation.mdx).
- **Mock Server**: This will be used to execute the fake server in order to simulate the API responses from the seller. For more details, check [Mock Server Configuration](../connector-framework/mock-server-documentation.mdx)
- **Connectors Integration Tests**: These tests assure that the integration has logic based on TG requirements. For more details, check [IntegrationTests](../connector-framework/running-integration-tests)
- **API Clients** such as Postman or Insomnia.

Connector Development process:

- To ensure a smooth experience for both parties, please develop the content, booking flow and booking management operation by operation, in order (Content -> Search -> Quote -> Book -> CheckByReference -> Cancel).
- In every operation, make sure tests of that operation work fine. There will be a final step in every operation where the developer will be shown how to pass the tests.
