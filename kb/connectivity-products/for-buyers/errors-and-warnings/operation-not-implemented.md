# OperationImplemented Information

## What Does the `operationImplemented` Tag Mean?
The `operationImplemented` tag (Boolean) is part of the Common Elements in our API response. It indicates whether the Supplier has implemented the requested method.

Example responses:
```
<operationImplemented>false</operationImplemented>
```
or
```
<operationImplemented>true</operationImplemented>
```

### What Can I Do If I Receive `operationImplemented: false` in My Response?
If you believe the Seller should implement this method, follow these steps:

1. **Contact the Seller Directly**
   - Reach out to the Seller to discuss implementing the method. They can assess whether it is possible on their end.
2. **Seller's Implementation**
   - If the Seller agrees, they should proceed with the necessary development and integration.
3. **Contact Us**
   - Once the Seller has implemented the method, they should notify us through our Support Portal.
4. **Provide API Documentation**
   - The Seller must submit their complete API documentation, helping our team understand the implementation details.
5. **Analysis and Implementation**
   - Our team will review the provided API documentation and work on implementing the method on our side.
