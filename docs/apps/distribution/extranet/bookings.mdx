# Bookings

Bookings Panel tool empowers you to access a comprehensive list of your agency's bookings and cancellations while also providing access to more in-depth details for each booking.

* Booking Search: For specific bookings and their comprehensive details.
* Booking List Reports: for a streamlined .csv list with essential information.

In both panels, you have the flexibility to employ a range of filters for precise booking searches or personalized list generation. These filters allow you to define the booking date or check-in date, choose to include cancellations (both effective and canceled bookings), focus only cancellations or errors, specify the hotel name and code, and filter by agency and provider. The sole distinction lies in the fact that, with Booking Search (booking details), you can filter by locator.

## Booking List Reports

Booking List Reports tool allows you to obtain a .csv file containing all the bookings that fall within the specified report parameters.

Important points to keep in mind:

* Please note that while you need to provide a valid name for the report in alphanumeric format, our system will also append a datetime format at the beginning of this name to ensure its uniqueness.

* Only one report can be generated every 15 minutes. Therefore, once a report generation request is made, users must wait for 15 minutes before requesting another.

* The report generation is not instantaneous and may take some time, depending on the volume of bookings to be processed. If the "Generation Status" reads "Executing," it means the file is still being processed and is not yet available for download.

* When the status changes to "Finished ok," the download button will become accessible.
