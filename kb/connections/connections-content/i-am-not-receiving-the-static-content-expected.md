# Content Discrepancies

### Why am I not receiving the content expected from a Seller?🔎
This can occur for the following reasons:

1. Your content has not been updated yet. Find more information on how to review and manage your Hotels content using our APP [here](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content.md).
1. The Seller has not provided certain mandatory fields, resulting in the exclusion of some items (e.g., hotels, destinations).
1. The Seller has not sent those particular items.
1. There might be an integration issue.
### What can I do to manage this discrepancy?🚀
1. Reach out to the Seller to ensure they are sending the missing information, including all the required fields specified in the [Seller API Specs](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/content/hotels) (refer to them for more information).
1. If the issue persists, you can try forcing an update of your content (this option is available for portfolio updates, find more information [here](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-force-portfolio-update.md)).
1. If the problem continues even after forcing an update of your content, please [open a ticket](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) to our Customer Care Team for further investigation.
### What can I do if I receive an error while downloading my content?💡
1. Make sure the credentials credentials in your request (Hotel-X accessCode or Legacy Configuration) are active and operative.
1. Check our [errors and warnings](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/lists-of-errors-and-warnings/overview) for further information. 
1. If you encounter an error while downloading the hotel, room, or destination list, it is recommended to restart the process.
1. If the issue persists or the error code is not listed, please open a ticket to our [Customer Care Team](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) to have the case investigated.
