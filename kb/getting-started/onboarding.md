# Onboarding Process

At Travelgate, we aim to make the onboarding process as seamless and efficient as possible for all our Partners. Our onboarding journey consists of two main phases: **Development** and **Customer Success**. Below is a breakdown of what to expect at each stage.

## Step 1: After Signing the Contract

Once you’ve signed the commercial contract, your onboarding process will follow one of two paths:

- **Using an Existing Platform** → You will skip the **Development** phase and proceed directly to **Customer Success**.
- **Implementing the Hotel-X Buyers API** → You will begin with the **Development** phase, where we guide you through API integration.

## Step 2: Development Phase (For Hotel-X API Users)

Our Onboarding team supports you through every step of the API implementation process:

- **Kickoff Email** → You will receive an introduction email with a presentation and a link to schedule a **Kickoff Call**.
- **Kickoff Call** → We will explain the core functions and features of the **Hotel-X API** and answer any technical questions.
- **Ongoing Support** → Our team is available for any API or documentation-related inquiries.
- **Periodic Check-ins** → We monitor your progress and offer assistance when needed to ensure a smooth implementation.

## Step 3: Certification & Transition to Customer Success

Once your **Hotel-X API** integration is complete, you can **request certification**, marking the transition to the **Customer Success phase**. The certification process ensures your integration is fully functional. After certification, our **Customer Success** team will help you maximize platform benefits and provide ongoing support.

## Step 4: Launch

Following certification, the **customer education process** begins, during which our **Customer Success** team will guide you on using the platform effectively. Below are the different phases:

1. **Launch Call Invite** → You will receive an email with pre-training materials and a link to schedule a **Launch Call**.
2. **Launch Call** → We will cover key platform features, including:
   - Credentials management
   - Creating new connections
   - Finding suppliers
   - Monitoring connections (Stats, Logging & Alerts)
   - Smart Traffic (Optimization Tools)
   - User management
   - Billing  

    This is an excellent opportunity to ask technical questions or clarify any doubts.  

3. **Post-Launch Email** → After the Launch Call, you will receive an email with a summary of the discussion and a link to the recorded session for future reference.
4. **Ongoing Support** → Our **Customer Success** team is available to assist with your first connections and bookings to ensure a smooth start.
5. **Periodic Status Updates** → We will check in on your progress until your first **Live Bookings** are successfully processed and will offer additional assistance if needed.
6. **Performance Reports** → Once live, our team will monitor your performance and provide insights on key KPIs, such as errors, **L2B (Look-to-Book ratio)**, and unavailability. We will also highlight areas for improvement and suggest optimizations for your connections.

At Travelgate, we are committed to providing continuous support throughout your onboarding journey. Whether you are integrating via an **existing platform** or implementing our **Hotel-X API**, we ensure a smooth and efficient process, assisting you at every step!
