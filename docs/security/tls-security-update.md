# TLS Security Update â€“ Enhanced Browser Compatibility Required

## Overview

At Travelgate, we continuously improve our security measures to ensure optimal protection and performance. Starting on March 24th, 2025, we will progressively update our TLS (Transport Layer Security) cipher suite requirements for accessing our platform at **[app.travelgate.com](https://app.travelgate.com/)**.

## What Is Changing?

We are elevating our minimum security standards to support only cipher suites classified as "**High Security Cipher Group**" or higher. TLS cipher suites determine how encrypted connections between your browser and our servers are established, securing all data transmissions.

This update means that only browsers capable of supporting these stronger cipher suites will continue to have uninterrupted access to the Travelgate platform.

## Why This Change?

Older cipher suites and outdated browser versions can present vulnerabilities. By upgrading our requirements, we:

- Ensure data privacy and protection from cybersecurity threats.
- Comply with industry-leading security standards.
- Provide an improved and safer user experience.

## Impact and Compatibility

If your browser does not support the new cipher suites, you will experience connectivity issues accessing our platform.

To guarantee uninterrupted access, please update your browser to at least the following versions (or higher):

- **Chrome:** version 88 or newer  
- **Firefox:** version 78 or newer  
- **Safari:** version 13 or newer  
- **Edge:** version 88 or newer  

## Technical Specifications of Supported Cipher Suites

We will support exclusively the following high-security cipher suites:

## Recommended Actions

We strongly recommend:

1. **Checking your browser version:** Ensure compatibility with the new requirements.
2. **Updating your browser promptly:** If your current version is outdated, update immediately to prevent potential access disruption.

## Timeline

We will begin implementing this upgrade progressively, starting on March 24th 2025. This approach ensures a smooth transition and minimizes any inconvenience.
