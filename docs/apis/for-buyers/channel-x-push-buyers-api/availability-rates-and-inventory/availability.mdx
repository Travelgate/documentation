After each request, a response should be provided from your side. If a `HotelAvailNotif` request is received, a corresponding `HotelAvailNotif` response should be sent. There are two response options, **success** or **error**.

:::caution

Our system has a timeout of 5000ms. If no response occurs within this timeframe, we won't attempt to resend the request. It is recommended that your system processes our requests with an average handling time of 100ms.
