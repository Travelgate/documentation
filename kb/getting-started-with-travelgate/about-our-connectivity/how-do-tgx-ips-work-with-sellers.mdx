# Travelgate Fixed IP Lists

### How Do Travelgate IPs Work with Sellers?

When you work as a Seller with Travelgate, the requests we send to you come from different IP addresses. Depending on your system’s configuration, you might handle these IPs in various ways:

- **No IP Filtering:** If your system doesn’t filter or block certain IP addresses, our system works dynamically. This means that we use different IPs that can change as our environment scales up or down. This flexibility comes from using dynamic environments in the cloud.

- **IP Filtering:** If your system does filter or allow only specific IP addresses, we have a set list of fixed IPs that we use. This ensures that all requests you receive from us always come from the same IPs. If we ever need to add or remove IPs from this list, we will let you know immediately, so you can update your system and allow the new IPs.

If you don’t currently filter by IP but would like all traffic to come from the same IP addresses, simply reach out to our Customer Support team. Let them know about your specific needs, and we’ll work together to see if we can adjust your setup to meet your requirements.

#### Understanding IP Ranges

Some of the IP addresses listed above are shown as ranges, like `172.98.36.0/27` or `216.59.58.248/29`. These ranges are provided as shorthand, and it's important to know that they cover multiple IP addresses, not just one.

## Does Travelgate Need to Whitelist My IPs? 💡
At Travelgate, we make sure all our IPs are whitelisted on the Seller’s system. However, **our system doesn’t filter by IP**, so there’s no need for us to whitelist your IPs. If you experience any issues, it’s not likely to be due to IP filtering.
If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to contact our Customer Support team!
