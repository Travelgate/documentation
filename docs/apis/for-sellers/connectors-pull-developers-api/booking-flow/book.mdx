## **Overview**

The `Book` operation is the final step in the booking workflow, used to confirm a reservation for a selected option. It involves providing detailed guest information, a client locator, the payment type, and credit card information when required. Once completed, the supplier processes the reservation and returns its status.
                                             
The `Book` operation ensures:
- **Guest Information Submission**: Transfers passenger details, including names, surnames, and any additional guest-specific data, to the supplier.
- **Payment Validation**: Confirms and processes payment if the supplier requires it at the booking stage.
- **Reservation Confirmation**: Secures the selected option and generates a unique supplier locator for future management (e.g., cancellation or check bookings).

When to Use:
- **Finalizing Reservations**: After `Quote`, when the selected option has been validated and confirmed.
- **Session-Based Suppliers**: For suppliers requiring additional validation or token updates during the booking process.
- **Immediate Confirmation**: For suppliers offering instant booking confirmation.

> **Note**: If the booking status is returned as `Unknown`, the Buyer is responsible for verifying with the Seller that the booking has been confirmed.

Common Scenarios:
- **Payment-Required Suppliers**: Includes credit card information as part of the `Book` request.
- **Error Handling**: Common errors include:
  - `SupplierBookingNotConfirmed`: Indicates that the booking could not be processed by the supplier.
  - `ItemNotAvailable`: Returned if the selected option is no longer valid at the time of booking.

## **Request**

The request object contains all necessary details to process the booking.

### **Overview**

The request object includes passenger details, payment information, client locator, and the selected option.

## **Response**

The response object contains the results of the booking operation.

### **Overview**

The `Book` operation returns:
- **Booking Status**:
  - `Confirmed`: The reservation was successfully completed without any issues.
  - `Unknown`: During the reservation process, an issue led to an unknown reservation status. The Buyer is responsible for verifying with the Seller that the booking has been confirmed.
  - `Canceled`: The reservation was completed but due to a supplier error or a timeout the system will immediately cancel the reservation to prevent further possible errors.
  - `On_Request`: Please note that a Book status may change over time: you may receive an ON_REQUEST status in Book response, and after running a Booking Query some seconds later the status may have already changed to OK.
- **Supplier Locator**: A unique identifier for the booking from the supplier, used for future operations like cancellation or check bookings.
- **Additional Details**: May include booking remarks or warnings specific to the supplier.
