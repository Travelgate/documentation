# Add Room

## Adding a Hotel to Your Inventory Setup

With Inventory, you can easily manage your personalized room type list across all connected Channel Managers. This allows you to reuse existing room types or create new ones as needed, eliminating the need for manual configuration for each Channel Manager.

### How to Add a Room Type to a Rate

#### 1. Using an Existing Room Type
- Navigate to the **SetUp/Rate** where you want to add a room.
- Click **"+ Add Room"**.
- Select a room code and description from your room master list using the autocomplete field.
- If needed, modify the room code (used by the Channel Manager for mapping purposes) for this rate.

#### 2. Creating a New Room Type
- Enter a **code** and **description** for the new room type.
- Save it, and the room type will be added to your room master list.
- Once saved, it will be available in the **All Room Types** section.
