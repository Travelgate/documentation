### How can I use Stats? 🔍
Once you're logged into [our Portal](https://www.travelgate.com/), simply click on APPs and then select **Stats**. By default, you'll see your Organization's statistics for the last hour. But don't worry, you have the flexibility to adjust the time range as per your requirements using the convenient selector in the top right corner.

**About the Time Range and Time Zone:**  

- If the selected period is *less than 7 days*, Stats will use your browser's time zone.
- If the selected period is *more than 7 days*, Stats will use the UTC time zone and display aggregated daily data.  
Let's clarify this with an example:  

    As of June 25, 2024, it is 12:00 PM, and the user is located in Madrid, Spain (time Zone: GMT +2 / UTC +2).
    - To see Stats for the last hour: Stats will use the browser's time zone and display data from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC+2).
    - To see Stats for yesterday between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM: Stats will the browser's time zone (UTC+2).
    - To see Stats for the last 7 days: Stats will display results considering browser's time zone up to 12:00 PM today (UTC+2).
    - When selecting a period older than the previous 7 days (eg: 2024-06-01  – 2024-06-12), Stats will show data for complete days (UTC).

:::info Legacy Pull Buyers API information
Please remember that for Buyer connections through our Legacy Pull Buyers API, filtering by Hotel-X Access Code is not available. Connections will be identified through the Buyer's **clientname#suppliercode** relationship.  
Note that some Buyers may be transitioning from the Legacy Pull Buyers API to the Hotel-X API, which means they could have traffic via both APIs. If in doubt, we strongly encourage you to **reach out to your Buyers** for more detailed information.
