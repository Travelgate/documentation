# Speed: Travelgate's Smart Cache

## What Is Speed?

At Travelgate, we continuously evolve our technology to meet our Partners’ needs. One key challenge is reducing traffic and improving Search response times. Our **dynamic cache solution, Speed**, helps optimize performance by saving up to **80% of total hits** to the Seller's system, resulting in significantly faster Search responses.

## Who Can Benefit from Speed and How

- **Sellers:**
  - Facing challenges with high traffic volumes or slow response times.
  - Looking to offer their product to Buyers more efficiently and increase sales opportunities.
  - Seeking to reduce traffic (hits) and minimize infrastructure costs.
- **Buyers:**
  - Requiring exceptionally fast Search response times (e.g., XML, B2B, metasearch Partners).
  - Needing quicker access to products beyond the limitations of the Seller’s system.

## Who Can Activate Speed?
Both **Buyers and Sellers** can activate Speed within Travelgate. However, **specific configurations are required**, such as selecting the operational mode and setting the cache storage time (TTL). Collaboration between Buyers and Sellers may be necessary to optimize Speed settings according to their needs.

:::info Consistent Traffic, Optimal Results!
To maximize the benefits of Speed, maintain a **high volume of requests and a consistent flow of traffic**. Monitor Speed's performance after activation and **adjust the TTL** if needed.
