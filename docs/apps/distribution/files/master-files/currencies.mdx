### File Format Specification

* **File Name:** Master_CurrenciesExchange.csv
* **Directory:** Distribution
* **Delimiter:** Hashtag (`#`)
* **Data:**
   * **ISO Currency Code (mandatory)**: 3 chars (e.g. EUR, USD,GBP etc.)
   * **Exchange value (mandatory)**: It indicates the equivalence of this currency with 1 unit of the base currency.
       * Decimal value has to be set using ‚Äò.‚Äô as separator. 
   * **Agency Code**: To create specific currencies. If the agency doesn't specify a currency, it defaults to global currency; otherwise, it uses the specified currencies.
* **Base Currency:**
   * The file must be created on a base currency, and all other currencies have to be defined with their exchange with this base currency.
   * TGX Distribution system operates using EUR as the base currency for all the internal operations, so if the file does not uses EUR as the base currency then the TGX Distribution team must be noticed of this point and needs to know which is the base currency.
   * The base currency must be included into the file and will have an exchange value of 1.
   * The exchange value of a currency indicates the equivalence of this currency with 1 unit of the base currency.
* **Note:**
   * The first line is not a header line: it contains data directly.
   * The data of the fields is not encapsulated by " or any other character.
   * Each line represents a currency exchange.
   * Any blank line will be skipped.
   * If a field‚Äôs data is not mandatory and we don‚Äôt want to set it then we just keep it empty: e.g. ‚Ä¶##‚Ä¶
   * The file and its data have to be encoded using UTF-8. Otherwise strange characters can be stored.
