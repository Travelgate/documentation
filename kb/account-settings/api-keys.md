# API Keys

In the API Keys section, you'll be able to check how many API keys you have configured for your organization, when they were created, and generate new ones.

## What is an API Key?

An API key (Apikey) is a unique alphanumeric code that serves as a form of authentication required for accessing our TravelgateX APIs, such as the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API. This key must be included in the HTTP Authorization request header to verify and authenticate the user agent with the server. It acts as a secure identifier, ensuring that only authorized users can make requests and access the API's functionalities.


## What's inside API Keys? 🔍

### Viewing API Keys

You can easily check the status and details of your API keys, including:

- **List of API Keys**: View the list of API keys you have.
- **API Key Details**: For each API key, you can see its name, creation date, and the final characters of the key. Note that for security purposes, the full Apikey cannot be recovered. If you need to perform API operations and you don't have your current API key, you'll need to generate a new one.
