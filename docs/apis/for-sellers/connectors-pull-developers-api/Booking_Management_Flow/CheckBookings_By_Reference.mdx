## **Overview**

The `CheckBookings By Reference` operation allows clients to retrieve the status of a specific booking using locators provided by both the client and the supplier. This operation is crucial for post-booking management and provides insights into the reservation status, any changes, or additional information supplied by the provider.

- **Booking Status Retrieval**: Enables clients to check if a booking is confirmed, canceled, or in an unknown state.
- **Supplementary Information**: Optionally returns additional details depending on the supplier's capabilities, such as:
  - Room details.
  - Payment status.
  - Guest details.
- **Error Management**: Helps identify issues with the booking using standardized error codes.

When to Use:

- **After Booking Confirmation**: To verify the booking status and details.
- **For Post-Booking Changes**: Before initiating cancellations or modifications to ensure the booking state is suitable.
- **Troubleshooting**: When the client suspects issues with a booking, such as discrepancies in supplier data.

*Common Scenarios:

- **Verify Booking Status**: Confirm whether a booking is still active or has been canceled.
- **Retrieve Guest Information**: Access guest details, especially for last-minute updates or changes.
- **Error Handling**: Common errors include:
  - `BookingNotFound`: Indicates the booking cannot be located with the provided locators.
  - `SupplierError`: Denotes an issue on the supplier's end, such as service unavailability.
