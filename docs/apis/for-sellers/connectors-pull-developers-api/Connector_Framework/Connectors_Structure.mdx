# Project Structure

To create a Connector, Travelgate will generate a unique code representing the Connector. This code will be used to set up the GitHub repository for your integration. External developers will receive access to a pre-configured repository.

When you download the repository, it will have the following structure:

## **Detailed Explanation of Operations**

### **1. Search**
- **Directory**: `/Search`
- **Purpose**: Performs a Search for hotel options based on the client’s criteria.
- **Methods**:
  - **TryValidateModelRequest**: Validates client requests for edge cases (e.g., checking specific Metadata constraints).
  - **BuildRequests**: Converts the Connector's request format into the supplier’s format.
  - **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Validates supplier responses for errors or anomalies.
  - **ParseResponses**: Converts the supplier’s response back into the Connector’s standardized format.
- For more details, see [Search](../Booking_Flow/Search.mdx).

---

### **2. Quote**
- **Directory**: `/Quote`
- **Purpose**: Confirms the details of a selected option, ensuring the data is up-to-date.
- **Methods**:
  - **TryValidateModelRequest**: Validates the client’s request for any specific constraints, such as Metadata-based restrictions.
  - **BuildRequests**: Maps the Connector's Quote request to the supplier’s expected format.
  - **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Validates the supplier’s Quote response for consistency and errors.
  - **ParseResponses**: Transforms the supplier’s Quote response into the Connector’s standardized format.
- For more details, see [Quote](../Booking_Flow/Quote.mdx).

---

### **3. Book**
- **Directory**: `/Book`
- **Purpose**: Confirms the booking of a selected option, ensuring all necessary passenger and payment details are included.
- **Methods**:
  - **TryValidateModelRequest**: Validates client requests for booking-specific constraints, such as passenger name requirements or payment validation.
  - **BuildRequests**: Converts the Connector’s booking request into the supplier’s format.
  - **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Checks for errors in the supplier’s booking response, such as payment rejections or unavailability.
  - **ParseResponses**: Converts the supplier’s booking response back into the standardized format, including booking confirmation or failure details.
- For more details, see [Book](../Booking_Flow/Book.mdx).

---

### **4. Cancel**
- **Directory**: `/Cancel`
- **Purpose**: Manages cancellation of a booking using supplier and client locators.
- **Methods**:
  - **TryValidateModelRequest**: Validates client requests to ensure required locators are present.
  - **BuildRequests**: Maps the Connector’s cancellation request to the supplier’s expected format.
  - **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Validates supplier responses for errors or issues with the cancellation.
  - **ParseResponses**: Converts the supplier’s cancellation response into the standardized Connector format, including status and penalties if applicable.
- For more details, see [Cancel](../Booking_Management_Flow/Cancel.mdx).

---

### **5. CheckBookings By Reference**
- **Directory**: `/CheckBookings/CheckBookingsByReference`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves booking status based on supplier and client locators.
- **Methods**:
  - **TryValidateModelRequest**: Validates the request for required locators or edge cases.
  - **BuildRequests**: Converts the Connector’s request into the supplier’s format.
  - **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Ensures supplier responses contain valid booking data.
  - **ParseResponses**: Converts the supplier’s response back into the standardized format, including detailed booking status.
- For more details, see [CheckBookings By Reference](../Booking_Management_Flow/CheckBookings_By_Reference.mdx).

---

### **6. CheckBookings By Dates**
- **Directory**: `/CheckBookings/CheckBookingsByDate`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves booking status for a date range (by check-in or booking date).
- **Methods**:
  - **TryValidateModelRequest**: Ensures valid date ranges and required parameters.
  - **BuildRequests**: Converts the Connector’s request into the supplier’s format.
  - **TryValidateSupplierResponses**: Validates supplier responses for anomalies.
  - **ParseResponses**: Maps the supplier’s response to the standardized Connector format, including booking statuses for the date range.
- For more details, see [CheckBookings By Dates](../Booking_Management_Flow/CheckBookings_By_Dates.mdx).

---

## **Other Key Files**
- **Binder.cs**: Handles validation of the `Access` data, ensuring required fields like `User`, `Password`, and custom parameters are valid. See [Access Data](../Access_Data/AccessData.mdx).
- **Extensions.cs**: Configures operations and defines `PlatformOptions`. See [View PlatformOptions](../Advanced_Configuration/PlatformOptions.mdx).
- **Program.cs**: Handles startup configuration; no modifications are typically needed.
- **TgxPlatform.cs**: Contains platform constants, such as the unique Connector code.

---

## **Testing**
- **MockServer**: Simulates supplier responses for testing purposes. See [MockServer](MockServer_Documentation.mdx).
- **UnitTests**: Contains test cases specific to the Connector's implementation.

---

This structure ensures consistency and adherence to Travelgate standards, providing a robust framework for Connector implementation.
