# Edit Hotel

## Manage Hotel Name Changes Efficiently

If a hotel has changed its name, you can update it in our Extranet by following these steps:

1. **Verify the new name** – Ensure it matches the official name as listed on the hotel's Platform. Do not include additional references, such as the hotel chain.
2. **Check your user role** – You must have a **“Client” or “Client Admin”** role to make this change. If you don’t, ask a team member with the necessary permissions.
3. **Request permission** – Submit a case in our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support) to request access to modify hotel names in the Inventory Extranet.
4. **Wait for approval** – Once our team processes your request, you’ll be able to update hotel names directly.

Even if you have Admin permissions, only the Travelgate team can modify a hotel name if it is also assigned to another client. If this applies to your case, don’t worry! Reach out to us via our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support), and we’ll be happy to assist you.

### Updates to Push Hybrid Hotel Codes

If you're purchasing from a property connected to Travelgate via a [Push Hybrid model](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/connectivity-services/pull-and-push-connectivity#2-push-hybrid), you can update the ["Code"](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup#how-to-create-a-new-hotel) field in the hotel card with the Channel Manager’s hotel code information.

If you have a **Client or Client Admin role** but are unable to make this change, please submit a case through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support), and our team will be happy to assist you.
