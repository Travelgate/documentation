# How to Audit Search Logs

Given the massive volume of search transactions—exceeding **6 billion per day**—Travelgate **does not store search transaction logs by default**. However, if you need to review search logs for troubleshooting, you can manually activate **Search Auditing**.

## How Can I Retrieve Search Logs to Review an Error?

Follow these steps to audit Search logs:
    1. Log into [Travelgate](https://www.travelgate.com/).
    2. Go to **Monitoring > Logging**.
    3. Select the **"Audit Search Logs"** option.
    4. **Choose the connection or access** for which you need Search logs. You can also review your Audit Searches History to track previous audits.
    5. **Start the audit**—our system will begin saving **5% of your Search traffic for 5 minutes**.

6. **Wait a few minutes** for the logs to be processed, then retrieve them in the Logging screen.  
7. **Apply the correct filter** by selecting **“Search”** as the **Operation Type** to view the audited logs.

## Requirements to Use the 'Audit Searches' Functionality
- Travelgate's system needs a **steady flow of traffic** (not just isolated requests) to accurately register Search transactions.  
- If you're in a **testing phase** or have **low traffic**, we recommend retrieving complete Search transactions **at the request level**. Follow the guidelines in this [article](/kb/platform/app-features/monitoring-tools/logging/audit-supplier-transactions) for more information.
