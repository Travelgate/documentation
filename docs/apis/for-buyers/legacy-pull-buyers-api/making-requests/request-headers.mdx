:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Legacy Buyers Request Headers

The following request headers are essential for all request methods and must be included in every API request.

### Mandatory Request Header

**Authentication**: Authentication is required for every request to the Travelgate XML API. The authentication header employs one level of authentication, namely "Security". 

The Security level header is situated in the SOAP envelope header of all requests, where the user and password are transmitted.

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" 
   xmlns:ns = "http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hub/2012/06" 
   xmlns:wsse = "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd">
     <soapenv:Header>
       <wsse:Security>
         <wsse:UsernameToken>
           <wsse:Username>username</wsse:Username>
           <wsse:Password>password</wsse:Password>
         </wsse:UsernameToken>
       </wsse:Security>
     </soapenv:Header>
```

:::info Where can I find my username and password??

1. We will send you your username and password during the onboarding process.

2. Every time you create a new client on the Travelgate website under Connections > [API Settings](https://app.travelgatex.com/connections/settings), the password will be displayed on the website only once.

3. If you need to recover any passwords, please [open a ticket](https://app.travelgatex.com/tickets) to our Customer Care team.
