## **Overview**

The `Cancel` operation allows clients to terminate a previously confirmed booking. It uses the client and supplier locators to identify the reservation and process the cancellation. Depending on the supplier's policies, penalties or fees may apply.

## **Purpose**
The `Cancel` operation ensures:
- **Reservation Termination**: Enables clients to cancel bookings through the supplier's API.
- **Penalty Calculation**: Returns any applicable cancellation fees based on the supplier's policies provided during `Quote`.
- **Status Confirmation**: Confirms the success or failure of the cancellation request.

## **When to Use**
- **Client-Initiated Cancellations**: When the end-user requests to cancel their reservation.
- **Penalty Validation**: To verify if a cancellation incurs fees before finalizing the process.

> **Note**: Always check the cancellation policies returned during `Quote` to inform the client about any penalties.

## **Response Details**
The `Cancel` operation provides:
- **Cancellation Status**:
  - `Canceled`: Indicates the reservation has been successfully canceled.
  - `Unknown`: The cancellation could not be processed by the supplier.
- **Cancellation Fees**: If applicable, the supplier may return a penalty fee for the cancellation.
- **Warnings or Remarks**: Additional details from the supplier about the cancellation process.

## **Common Scenarios**
- **Penalty-Based Cancellations**: Applies when the supplier charges fees for cancellations based on policies.
- **Error Handling**: Common errors include:
  - `SupplierError`: Indicates the cancellation could not be processed by the supplier.

## **Technical Details**
- **Request Object**:
  - Includes client and supplier locators and any additional data required by the supplier.
