### Clarity is Key

- Clearly state the reason for your inquiry and what prompts you to contact support. Formulate your queries in full sentences to help AIna better understand your intent (purpose) and provide accurate responses.
- Always specify any errors and warnings you encounter to ensure AIna’s response effectively addresses your issue. Provide relevant log snippets where applicable.
- Please include all essential details in the **'Description'** field when using AIna in the Support Cases section, as this is what AIna relies on to address your issue. This ensures faster potential resolution and also equips our support team with the necessary information to assist you effectively.

:::warning Error Details
When reporting an error, please include relevant snippets from the **error and warning logs in Travelgate's response** (or ‘applicationError’ for responses via the Legacy Pull Buyers API) to help us provide the best possible assistance.

:::

### Use Specific Keywords

Include specific terms or keywords related to your inquiry, such as:

- API in use (e.g., Hotel-X, Channel-X, Inventory, etc.).
- The method (e.g., Search, Quote, Hotels, etc.).
- Your organization type (Buyer or Seller).
- The APP or solution being used (Inventory, Distribution).
- Any specific error messages encountered.

### Break Down Complex Queries

Divide complex questions into smaller, more manageable parts to facilitate accurate responses.

### Provide Context and Avoid Assumptions

Offer necessary background information, such as the specific service or feature involved, and avoid assuming AIna has prior context from past interactions. Provide full details each time you start a conversation.

### Follow Up and Clarify

If the initial response doesn't fully resolve your query, don't hesitate to ask again! Additionally, when engaging with AIna in the [Support Cases](/kb/tickets/travelgatex-tickets#aina-and-customer-support-cases) section, you can refine your question by selecting **'Go back and rephrase your question'** at the top of the response.

### AIna: Your Support Ally

AIna provides quick answers and guidance for troubleshooting errors but cannot modify platform settings or access Partner account details. However, it can direct you to the appropriate steps to review or update your account details effectively.

## Interacting with AIna: Dos and Don’ts 💡

### Case 1

**Correct Example:**

"Hi AIna, I'm currently working on my Hotel-X development and need to know if there are any character limitations for passenger names and surnames in a booking. Could you provide this information?"

- This query is well-structured and specific, providing essential details such as the API in use and the exact requirement. It includes specific keywords such as "Hotel-X development", "booking", "passenger names and surnames" and "character limitations," which assist AIna in identifying the query. By providing a complete question in full sentences, it helps AIna understand the user's intent more effectively.

**Incorrect Example:**

"Hi, I have a question about the character limit."

- This query is too vague and lacks necessary context, making it difficult for AIna to provide an accurate response. 

### Case 2

**Correct Example:**

"Hello AIna, I'm trying to make a booking in Hotel-X Pull Buyers API, but I'm getting a 102 error - Provider error message in Book response. Could you help me identify the issue? Here is the error message: [insert error snippet]."

- Providing specific details about the error code and context helps AIna deliver a precise response.

**Incorrect Example:**

"Hello! I'm trying to book, but I'm getting an error. Can you help?"

- The lack of specifics such as the API and error code makes it challenging for AIna to assist effectively.

### Case 3

**Correct Example:**

"Hello AIna, I need an update on case ID 38272xxxx08432903. Could you guide me on how to access this information?"

- This query sets clear expectations and provides the necessary details for AIna to guide appropriately.

**Incorrect Example:**

"I need information on case ID 38272xxxx08432903. What's the status?"

- The question assumes AIna has access to account details, which it does not.

### Case 4

**Correct Example:**

"Hello AIna, we're experiencing an issue with reservation statuses in the Hotel-X API. We receive 'Booking status: UN' in the Book Mutation response and 'Booking status: OK' in the Booking Query response. Could you provide steps to resolve this?"

- The detailed explanation of the issue allows AIna to suggest appropriate troubleshooting steps.

**Incorrect Example:**

"We're getting conflicting messages on reservations. Can you fix this?"

- This lacks specificity and does not provide enough information for AIna to assist effectively. It also overlooks the fact that AIna cannot perform actions or make modifications on the platform.
