:::caution
To ensure a successful implementation, candidates should possess the following foundational knowledge and skills:

1. **Good understanding of the Travel Trade business**: This means knowing how hotels, sellers, and buyers work together, and how they usually deal with their partners.
2. **Experience with C# programming**: You should be comfortable using C#, since it's the main language used in development. It's also important to understand basic software testing (like unit tests and integration tests).
3. **Knowledge of Travelgate's Data Model**: You need to understand how Travelgate organizes data about options, rooms, boards, and policies [(Check Travelgate's Business Model)](../../../../get-started/travelgate-business-model)). This helps connect everything properly with the seller’s API.

:::

To begin developing a connector, ensure the following are in place:

- Seller's API documentation should be analized and approved by Travelgate.
- You must have a GitHub account, as Travelgate will assign the license to it.
- Download the template (both Shopping and Content templates). Travelgate will provide you with them.
- Join the Discord channel—Travelgate will share the link with you.

Tools you may need:

- **FormTest**: An useful Travelgate tool that will allow you to make requests directly to the Connector. For more details, check [FormTest Documentation](../Tools_and_Helpers/FormTest_Documentation.mdx).
- **API Clients** such as Postman or Insomnia.
