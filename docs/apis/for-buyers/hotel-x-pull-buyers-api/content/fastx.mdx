# FastX Codes

**FastX codes** are unique identifiers created by Travelgate to make connectivity across the Marketplace easier and more efficient.  
They represent a unified way to identify **hotels**, **boards**, and **rooms**, so you can work with multiple Suppliers using a single, consistent set of codes.

As a Buyer, you only need to map to the FastX codes — once you do, you can seamlessly access and book content from any connected Supplier without having to remap each one individually.

To make mapping even easier, **FastX codes are available in GIATA** under the name `"travelgate"`. This means that if you already use GIATA, integrating with Travelgate becomes even simpler — everything aligns smoothly.

The sections below explain how FastX codes work and how you can retrieve them through our API.


## Hotels

There are two ways to obtain FastX hotel codes:

### 1. FastX Hotel Master

This is a single call that returns the **master list of FastX hotels** available to you in the Travelgate Marketplace. It includes all unique hotels offered by the Sellers you are connected to. As you add new Sellers, any new properties they provide — not already offered by your other connected Suppliers — are automatically included in your master list.

To retrieve it, make a `hotel list` call using your **FastX access**, which you can find in the *MyConnections* section under the Seller **“Travelgate”**.

You can also receive the **GIATA code** associated with each hotel if you have activated [this functionality](/kb/connectivity-products/for-buyers/mapping-solutions/giata/giata-multicodes).

### 2. Hotel List by Supplier

Travelgate maintains full transparency. In addition to FastX codes, you can also access each Supplier’s static data. When you make a `hotel list` call to a specific Supplier access, you’ll receive:

- The Supplier’s **native hotel code** and hotel information.
- The **FastX hotel code** in the `mappings` node.
- The **GIATA code**, if you have activated [this functionality](/kb/connectivity-products/for-buyers/mapping-solutions/giata/giata-multicodes).

This allows you to keep your systems synchronized with both the standardized FastX codes and each Supplier’s own identifiers.

## Boards

To get the list of **FastX boards**, make a `boards` call using your **FastX access** (available in *MyConnections* under “Travelgate”). This will return the complete set of meal plans you’ll encounter in the booking flow — all identified with standardized FastX codes and names.

## Rooms

With FastX, Travelgate standardizes room names and codes across all connected Suppliers. We process each Supplier’s room descriptions in real time and convert them into **unique FastX room codes and standardized names**.

When you perform a **search** call, you’ll receive both:

- The **FastX standardized room code and name**  
- The **Supplier’s native code and description**

This ensures a consistent experience across the Marketplace while keeping full visibility into each Supplier’s original data.
