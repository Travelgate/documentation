# How to copy an access


In order to speed up the process of copying a pre-existing access and minimize typographical errors when filling in the access form, we have enabled the "Copy Access" feature in the section [My Connections](https://app.travelgatex.com/connections/myconnections):

1. **Select Connection/s**: click in [My Connections](/kb/connections/my-connections/) and filter the access to be copied, then click on “Actions” and choose the function “Copy access”
1. **Check and complete the "Copy access" pre-filled form**. Note that you may still need to edit/fill in some fields, since they include sensitive information:
	- Access name: the access name is filled in by default with the copied access name and the prefix COPY_ in order to distinguish it from the original one. Choose a distinctive name for the new access.
	- Notification emails: add your email/s so you can be notified about the activation process status.
	- Set your credentials for that specific connection. Remember to check all the fields in the form in case you need to modify some information before requesting the activation.
1. **Activation Process**: The activation process is similar to any other activation and may take some time. Don't forget to check our articles on [Auto-Activations](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) for further information.
