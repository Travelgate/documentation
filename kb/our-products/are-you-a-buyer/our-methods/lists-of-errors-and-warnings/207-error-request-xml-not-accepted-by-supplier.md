# 207 error - Request XML not accepted by Supplier

### What does a 207 error mean?💡
A 207 error will occur if your request does not conform to the Seller's specifications.

### What can I do as a Buyer if I receive 207 errors in my response?
1. **Review the Supplier’s Metadata**: 207 errors occur when a Buyer’s request does not align with the Seller’s specifications. If you receive a 207 error, [check their metadata](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/content/metadata) for the method to ensure your request meets the specified limitations.
2. If there is a discrepancy between the supplier’s metadata and the specifications confirmed on their end, contact the Seller directly to have them report the issue through our portal. They should provide the most updated API documentation, allowing our IT team to review and update their metadata accordingly.

Remember to **check the limitations set by the Seller for each method** using our [Metadata Query](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/static-content/hotel-x-metadata-query) to avoid errors and unnecessary traffic.
