# Commission

Commission plugin defines the contracted/expected commission in cases where the Supplier is not able to send it via integration. The commission loaded in the SFTP is considered as a Gross commission, meaning that the commission or profit is already included in the price.

To get started with the Commission plugin, follow these simple steps:

## 1. Create and Upload your Commission File

To get started, create your commission file in the correct format and then upload it to your SFTP account. We've provided a template file below ⬇️ to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your own rules, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your SFTP.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

📁HotelX  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📁HotelX_0000  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📁BusinessRules  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **📄[RequestContext_sequential_commission.csv](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/RequestContext_sequential_commission.csv)**

</BrowserWindow>
```

:::note

If you need assistance with requesting your credentials to access the SFTP server, determining the endpoint and directory format, or learning how to upload, update, and delete SFTP files, please refer to the [overview](../plugins/overview) section of Plugins.

:::info File Name
"RequestContext" on the file name depends on the context you use in your query:
* If you use your own Buyer context (multi mode search) you only need to load 1 file with your context in the name (BuyerContext_sequential_commission.csv).
* If you use the Supplier context (single mode search) you will need to load 1 file for each supplier with the Supplier context in the name (SupplierContext_sequential_commission.csv).

### Check Some of the Most Common Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the Commission plugin, along with the CSV template file to use:

| Use Case                                                      | CSV Template file             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| The error message "WRONG_FIELD" - "PLUGIN_ERROR" (some of the options have been discarded because we don't know if the price is gross or net) indicates that some options have been discarded due to the supplier's inability to specify whether the price is gross or net in the connector. This file is useful, for example, if you are using the Hotel-X API with the supplier "SUP1" codes and want to specify that you work with net prices since you have not established any commission with them, resulting in a 0% commission rate.  | 📄[SUP1\_sequential\_commision.csv](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/SUP1_sequential_commission.csv) |


## 2.  Execute Commission Plugin in your Request

In the case of the commission plugin, there is no need to indicate it in the requests. Simply uploading the file to the SFTP it will start working, no further action is required.
