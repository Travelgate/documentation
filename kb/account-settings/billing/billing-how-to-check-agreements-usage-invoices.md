### How can I request a payment type change for one of my Partners?

Remember that if both you and your Partner are under the **Commercial Agreement 2023**, the [Auto-Activations form](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations/) to request a new connection on our Platform will display these [available payment types](/kb/account-settings/billing/billing-payment-types):

- **FREE:** This connection has no cost for you. Your Partner must confirm the full payment of the connectivity from its side.
- **STD:** Standard booking fee applies for you and your Partner, share costs.
- **SUP:** Both standard booking fees and supplement apply to this connection for you. For your Partner, it will be free.

It's possible that you and your Partner are currently splitting the cost of the connection under a Standard Payment Agreement. If you're interested in switching to a free arrangement where your Partner takes on the payment responsibility, you'll need to **wait for their acceptance** before proceeding with the change. If needed, you can also cancel the request.

Other modifications, such as switching from **Free to Standard** or **Standard to Supplement**, do not require Partner confirmation as the total cost of the connection is assumed. These changes can be processed automatically.

Additionally, you will have access to the **historical record** of changes made in each agreement:

- Keep in mind that your Partner needs to log in through their Profile to **accept the payment change request**. They will receive a notification in the bell-shaped icon located on the right side of the settings menu.
- Any changes made to the payment type will apply to all reservations with an entry date starting from the first day of the following calendar month after the notification.
- Remember, if you have an agreement 2023, you will have the option to **choose the Payment Type** during the [auto-activation process](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).
- A payment change **can only be requested if you're adhering to the Commercial Agreement 2023**.
