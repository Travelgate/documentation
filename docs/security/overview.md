# Overview

Travelgate is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of security and data protection. As an [ISO 27001 certified solution](https://docs.travelgate.com/docs/security/iso_27k/what_is/), we strictly adhere to rigorous security protocols. This certification guarantees that your business's sensitive information remains protected against potential threats, freeing you to concentrate on your core operations without the worry of data breaches.

To facilitate the reporting of security vulnerabilities, Travelgate provides a clear and accessible method for external researchers to communicate these concerns. Researchers can contact us via a [public email address](https://docs.travelgate.com/docs/security/iso_27k/faq/#do-you-have-an-easily-detectable-way-for-external-researchers-to-report-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-systems), where reported vulnerabilities are promptly reviewed, categorized, and forwarded to the appropriate department for swift resolution.

In terms of intrusion detection or prevention, Travelgate utilizes [IDS/IPS](https://docs.travelgate.com/docs/security/iso_27k/faq/#are-intrusion-detection-or-prevention-tools-idsips-available) (Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems) tools. These tools compare network traffic against known signatures or behaviors associated with thousands of types of exposures (cybercriminal tools, trojans, and other malicious software) and send alerts or halt the attempt when detected. TravelGate employs Sentinel tools for Google, Azure, and Github.

Travelgate also has an [Information Security Management System (ISMS)](https://docs.travelgate.com/docs/security/iso_27k/faq/#does-the-supplier-have-an-information-security-management-system-isms) certified with ISO 27K. This system continuously feeds its objectives and opportunities by identifying possible points of improvement that may arise from activities such as internal audits and internal and external reports.
