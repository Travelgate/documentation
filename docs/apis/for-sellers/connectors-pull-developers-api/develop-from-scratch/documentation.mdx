# Documentation

The connector documentation will be stored in the `docs/` directory, which will also be used as context for Copilot.  
The `docs/` directory will include the following subfolders: `docs/analysis/`, `docs/certification/`, and `docs/supplier/`, each providing additional context about the supplier's API.

- The `docs/analysis/` folder will be pre-filled and will contain a **technical analysis** summarizing the different (JSON or XML) calls and business logic (such as `Metadata`) of the supplier’s API.  
- The `docs/certification/` folder will initially be empty and should later contain **production logs and examples** from the certification process with the supplier’s API, once the connector has been completed and certified.  
- The `docs/supplier/` folder will also be pre-filled and will include the **supplier’s API specification file**, which provides the official documentation for the supplier’s API.

---

### **Format Clarification**
- `<Version>` must follow the format `X.X.X` (e.g., `1.0`, `2.0.2`, etc.).  
- `<Date>` must follow the format `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `20250903`).

## Supplier Documentation

The supplier-specific API documentation is stored in the `docs/supplier/` directory.  
Each file should follow the naming format `spec_<Version>.md`, corresponding to the supplier API version.

---

## Certification

The connector certification files will be stored in the `docs/certification/` directory.  
This section provides **production examples and logs** used to validate the connector’s API calls against the supplier’s API.  
It is structured to help coding agents and LLMs understand the layout and use of real-world certification data.

The directory will include a file named `docs/certification/certification_<Version>_<Date>.md`, which describes the expected structure of certification files.

---

### Structure Overview

Two main folders must be created inside the `docs/certification/` directory.

---

#### Travelgate Certification Folder

A folder named `docs/certification/travelgate/` should be created to store the connector certification from **Travelgate’s side**.

Within this folder, the following directories should exist, each representing a certification type:

- **Connectors/**  
- **HotelX/**  
- **Legacy/**  

![Certification Folders](/img/docs/connectors-pull-developers-api/CertificationFolders.png)

Each of these directories must contain **four subfolders**, representing different booking flow scenarios for certification:

- `1Rooms@1Adults+1Childs/`  
- `1Rooms@2Adults/`  
- `2Rooms@1Adults+1Childs@2Adults/`  
- `2Rooms@2Adults@2Adults/`  

Each scenario folder should include **production examples** for all main connector operations (e.g., `Search`, `Quote`, `Book`, `Cancel`, `CheckBookingByReference`, etc.) generated during the connector certification process.

#### Supplier Certification Folder

A folder named `docs/certification/supplier/` should also exist within the certification directory.  
It will contain the supplier’s own certification data, if a certification process is performed by the supplier.

## Technical Analysis of an API

The technical analysis files will be stored in the `docs/analysis/` directory.  
Each file should follow the naming format `analysis_<Version>_<Date>.md`.  
These files will provide additional **technical context** about the supplier’s API, organized according to the following table structure:

| ID | Category | Mandatory Category | Checkpoint | Details | Mandatory Checkpoint | Result | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
