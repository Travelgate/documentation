# Why Choose Hotel-X?

### Whether You Want to Aggregate or Not, Hotel-X Has You Covered

[Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) is a powerful GraphQL-based aggregation API. With a single connection, you gain access to the largest network of Buyers and Sellers, trusted by industry leaders and niche providers worldwide.

_Connecting new Sellers has never been easierâ€”no additional development, no maintenance._

### What Makes Hotel-X Different?

The Hotel-X API **aggregates results** from multiple Sellers while keeping your connection simple and standardized through FastX codes â€” Travelgateâ€™s unique identifiers for hotels, rooms, and boards. These codes ensure a seamless integration experience, allowing you to interact with any Supplier in the Marketplace through a single, unified structure.

Whether you prefer aggregation at the hotel level, at the hotel and board level, or even at the hotel, board, and room type levelâ€”or if you choose not to aggregate at allâ€” Hotel-X adapts to your business needs.

Enhance your Hotel-X experience by incorporating [Plugins](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/overview). These plugins allow seamless integration of custom business logic, such as currency conversion, hotel blacklisting, and selecting the most cost-effective meal plans. Simple. Flexible. Efficient.
