# Hotel-X Essentials

## Hotel-X Endpoint

To access all methods available through the Hotel-X API, use the endpoint **https://api.travelgate.com** (for both test and production environments).

## API Headers and Performance Optimization

To ensure smooth operation and maximize efficiency, requests should include specific headers and follow best practices for performance.

### Mandatory Headers

- **GZIP Compression**: Required to enhance performance and reduce bandwidth consumption. All live traffic must enable GZIP compression in the HTTP header.

- **API Key Authorization**: Authentication is mandatory for every request to the Travelgate GraphQL API. The API Key must be included in the HTTP **Authorization** request header.

- **Keep-Alive Header**: To optimize response times in search transactions, include the **Connection: keep-alive** header.

### Optional Headers

- **Operation Timeout**: This optional header allows specifying a maximum waiting time for Travelgate to process a request in the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API. It should always be set to a higher value than the timeout sent to the supplier. This header should not be confused with the timeout field used in booking flow requests.

- **GraphQL to REST**: Recommended when expecting more than 5,000 options per search response. This feature improves performance and ensures efficient data handling.

   #### Implementation Steps for GraphQL to REST:
   1. Update your JSON parser to the latest schema to avoid unexpected JSON marshalling.
   2. Include the HTTP header:
      ```http
      TGX-Content-Type: graphqlx/json
      ```
   3. Test a sample call using this header.

## Hotel-X API Languages

### Supported Languages

Hotel-X API does not impose language restrictions, but individual **Sellers may support different languages**. It is essential to verify the supported languages before proceeding.

### How to Check a Sellerâ€™s Supported Languages

To determine which languages a specific Seller supports, use the [Metadata Query](/kb/connectivity-products/for-buyers/hotel-x/content/metadata) method. Additionally, contact the Seller directly to confirm language support **before activation**.
