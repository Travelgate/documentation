# Get Started

As a valued TravelgateX Associate Platform Partner, your accurate connection setup is crucial for a seamless experience. Our step-by-step guide will help you quickly start purchasing from our Sellers, maximizing our Platform.

### Step 1: Set up Your Members✔️
Make sure to include all the individuals who require access to our network by following these [instructions](/kb/account-settings/users-management/how-to-add-manage-users-to-organization). It is important to note that the members you add may have access to sensitive information, such as your TravelgateX credentials or invoices, depending on the role assigned to them.

### Step 2: Update Your Profile✔️
To make the most out of your experience with our Partners, take a moment to [update your Profile](/kb/account-settings/company-profile/how-to-edit-and-customize-profile). Your Profile serves as your introduction to our Network, and a polished profile can create even greater opportunities for you.

### Step 3: Configure and Retrieve your TravelgateX credentials✔️
In this step, you will configure and obtain your TravelgateX credentials. Follow the instructions provided to ensure you have the necessary access to our Platform.

1. **Hotel-X Pull Buyers API🚀**

	_You need to follow this step only if you are connected to our Network through our Hotel-X Pull Buyers API._

	- **API Key🔎**  
		An Apikey is a unique alphanumeric code that serves as a form of authentication required for accessing Hotel-X API. This key must be included in the HTTP Authorization request header to verify and authenticate the user agent with the server. It acts as a secure identifier, ensuring that only authorized users can make requests and access the API's functionalities. You can find your Apikey (**encrypted**) and generate new ones in section Connections > [API Settings](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/settings).

		For further details, check out our "Hotel-X Credentials" [article](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/getting-started-with-hotel-x-buyers-api/hotel-x-credentials).

	- **Clients:🔎**  
		Client names are used to identify the company making the request. As an Associate Platform Partner, you should create a Client for each customer purchasing accommodation through you from any Seller connected to our Network.

	:::info
	Remember, when making requests through Hotel-X API, **use the client associated with the Customer who made the request** on your end. You can learn all about how to create clients [here](/kb/connections/connections-settings). You can create as many Clients as the number of Customers you work with; there are no restrictions.

1. **Legacy Pull Buyers API🚀**

	You need to follow this step **only** if you are connected to our Network through our Legacy Pull Buyers API.

	- **Hubusers and Passwords🔎**  
		The Hubusers and Passwords help recognize the Organization making the request. Since you are an Associate Platform Partner, you should create a Hubuser and a Password for each of the Customers buying accommodation through you from any of the Sellers connected to our Network.

		To create a new Hubuser and Password, simply follow the [same process](/kb/connections/connections-settings) as for creating new clients. Please ensure that you save the generated password once a new client (Hubuser) is created.

	:::info
	Remember, when making requests through the Legacy API, **use the client associated with the Customer who made the request** on your end. You can learn all about how to create hubusers (clients) [here](/kb/connections/connections-settings). You can create as many Hubusers and Passwords as the number of Customers you work with; there are no restrictions.

### Step 4: Activate new Sellers✔️
Now, let's start by requesting connections. Just follow these easy [steps](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) to send your activation requests.

As an Associate Platform Partner, your Customers might have unique credentials for each Seller. This means you might need to request **multiple connections with the same Seller, each for a different Customer**.

To keep things clear, we recommend **adding specific names to your connections**. For example: clientname_sellername. Additionally, you might also have **several credentials for a single connection Customer-Seller**, such as B2B and B2C credentials. In this case, we also recommend using clear names for easy identification. For instance: clientname_sellername_b2b.
