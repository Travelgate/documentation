# How to add a hotel to the Inventory Extranet

### How can I add a hotel to my Inventory SetUp?
Inventory's system works with its own **master hotel database** where we store all the basic information of the hotels configured by our Partners. To add a new hotel to your SetUp simply follow the steps below:

1. Access our Inventory Extranet.
2. Click on Inventory>SetUp (top menu).
3. Click on **+Add Hotel** and introduce the hotel name in the Autocomplete field. Our system will display all the properties that match your input.
