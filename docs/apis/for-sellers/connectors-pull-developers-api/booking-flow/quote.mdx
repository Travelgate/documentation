## **Overview**

The `Quote` operation is a crucial step in the booking workflow, used to confirm the details of an option previously retrieved in a `Search`. Since suppliers often rely on cached data or dynamic pricing, the `Quote` operation ensures that the selected option's price and policies are up-to-date before proceeding to a booking.

The `Quote` operation serves several purposes:
- **Price Validation**: Confirms the price of the selected option to account for potential changes since the `Search` response.
- **Policy Confirmation**: Validates the cancellation policies, payment terms, and other conditions tied to the selected option.
- **Data Reliability**: Ensures that all data is accurate and aligned with the supplier’s current availability before proceeding to the `Book` operation.

:::note
Always prioritize data from `Quote` over `Search`, as `Quote` reflects the most accurate and reliable information.
:::

When to use `Quote`:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: For suppliers that update prices frequently, this step confirms current rates.
- **Session-Based Suppliers**: For suppliers with expiring sessions or tokens, `Quote` helps ensure that the data remains valid.
- **Buyer Confidence**: Provides clients with an additional layer of assurance about the selected option’s details.

Common Scenarios:
- **Price Changes**: If the supplier's price differs from the `Search` response, the `Quote` operation will provide the updated price. 
  - Example: A `PriceChanged` error code is returned if there’s a discrepancy. (See [Error Handling in Connectors](../connector-framework/error-handling-in-connectors.mdx)).
- **Option No Longer Available**: If the selected option is no longer valid, the response may include an `ItemNotAvailable` error code.
## **Cancel Policies in Quote**

Cancellation policies provided during the **Quote** step are critical for Travelgate, as they offer clear and up-to-date information about cancellation terms, deadlines, and penalties. This transparency empowers buyers to make informed decisions and helps prevent misunderstandings or unexpected charges.

:::note
The cancellation policies shown in Search may differ from those shown in Quote.
This can happen because some suppliers do not return cancellation policies during the search phase, or because conditions may change between the two calls.
The valid and final cancellation policy will always be the one received in the Quote response.
This behavior is expected and should be taken into account.
:::

The `Quote` response includes key fields such as:

- Whether the option is **refundable** or not.
- A detailed list of **penalties** associated with cancellation.
- The exact **cancellation deadline**, always expressed in **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**.

By delivering this data in a consistent and precise format, Travelgate ensures that all parties involved—buyers, sellers, and final customers—have a shared understanding of the financial implications before confirming a booking.

:::important
Accurate handling of cancellation policies is essential to avoid financial discrepancies and maintain trust across the Travelgate ecosystem.

### **Internal Cancellation Policy Model**

At Travelgate, we use a standardized model to represent cancellation policies, allowing us to consistently translate information coming from a wide range of suppliers. Below is a breakdown of the core components of this model.

#### **Key Elements of a Cancellation Policy**

A cancellation policy is composed of a list of penalties (`CancelPenalties`). Each penalty includes the following information:

* **`PenaltyType`**: Specifies the type of penalty applied upon cancellation. It can be a fixed amount, a number of nights, or a percentage of the total cost.
* **`Currency`**: Indicates the currency in which the penalty value is expressed.
* **`Value`**: The amount of the penalty (either a monetary value, a number of nights, or a percentage). It usually corresponds to the net amount (without commission) the client must pay. If the supplier only provides a gross price (with commission), the penalty will be calculated using that price. Travelgate attempts to detect the price type and align it with the cancellation policy to ensure consistency throughout the booking process.
* **`Deadline`**: Date on UTC Standard TimeZone in which this cancellation policy applies (ISO 8601 UTC `2025-11-01T05:00:00Z`).

:::note
`Deadline` and `HoursBefore` represent the same concept—the time at which the penalty is triggered. The difference is that one is absolute (`Deadline`) and the other is relative (`HoursBefore`).

#### **Internal Model Structure in C\#**

```csharp
public class CancelPolicy
{
    protected CancelPolicy() { }

    public CancelPolicy(bool refundable, IEnumerable<CancelPenalty> cancelPenalties)
    {
        Refundable = refundable;

        if (refundable)
        {
            CancelPenalties = cancelPenalties ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cancelPenalties));
        }
    }

    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public bool Refundable { get; init; }

    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public IEnumerable<CancelPenalty> CancelPenalties { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public string CancelPolicyDescription { get; set; }
}

[DataContract]
[Serializable]
public class CancelPenalty
{
    private CancelPenalty() { }

    public CancelPenalty(uint hoursBefore, PenaltyType penaltyType, Currency currency, double value, string deadline = default)
    {
        HoursBefore = hoursBefore;
        PenaltyType = penaltyType;
        Currency = currency;
        Value = value;
        Deadline = deadline;
    }

    [DataMember(Order = 1)]
    public uint HoursBefore { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 2)]
    public PenaltyType PenaltyType { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 3)]
    public Currency Currency { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 4)]
    public double Value { get; set; }

    [DataMember(Order = 5)]
    public string Deadline { get; set; }
}

public enum PenaltyType
{
    Amount,    // Fixed amount
    Nights,    // Number of nights
    Percentage // Percentage of the total booking cost
}
```


## **Request**

The Request is structured to accommodate various parameters to their Quote operation.

### **Overview**

Represents the structure of the `Quote` request, including required fields such as `optionId` and `occupancy`.
