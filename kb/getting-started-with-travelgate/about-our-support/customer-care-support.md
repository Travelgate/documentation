### What does Travelgate not do?🛠️
Our core focus lies in providing **seamless connectivity solutions**. As a result, we don't offer services like booking engine, voucher generator system, front/back-office systems, website design, etc.

Nevertheless, we have established partnerships with numerous affiliates who specialize in these domains, and we would be more than happy to connect you with them.

### How are Partner requests categorized at Travelgate?💡
1. **Product Development:** This involves any development work aimed at enhancing, adding, or modifying functionalities of an existing product and/or service. For example:
	- "I would like to have the option to download more than 50 logs at once from the Logging APP".
	- API Major Version release for an existing integration (e.g. v1.0 to v2.0).

2. **Product Maintenance:** This encompasses any development efforts focused on ensuring the proper performance of an existing product and/or service. For example:
	- Booking flow data discrepancy.
	- Static data download error/discrepancy.
	- Minor API Updates: "As a Seller, I can now return cancel policies in Search, please update this information".
