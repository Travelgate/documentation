# Content Discrepancies

### Why am I not receiving the content expected from a Seller?🔎
This can occur for the following reasons:

1. Your content has not been updated yet. Find more information on how to review and manage your content using our APP [here](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content.md).
1. The Seller has not provided certain mandatory fields, resulting in the exclusion of some items (e.g., hotels, destinations).
2. The Seller has not sent those particular items.
### What can I do to manage this discrepancy?🚀
1. Reach out to the Seller to ensure they are sending the missing information, including all the required fields expected at an integration level.
2. If the issue persists, you may [force an update of your content](/kb/connections/connections-content/how-to-check-my-connections-content#how-can-i-use-the-force-update-now-functionality).
3. If the problem continues even after forcing an update of your content, please [open a Case](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md) to our Customer Support Team for further investigation.

:::info Force Content Updates
When performing a "Force content now" update to refresh a Seller's portfolio, please note that **the duration depends on the size of the content**. We recommend waiting a reasonable amount of time, such as a couple of hours, to ensure the update is fully processed. If the update is not completed after this period, consider running the force update again if necessary.

In cases where you've followed the steps above and still do not have the most up-to-date content, please don't hesitate to reach out through our [Support Portal](/kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team) for further help. We're here to ensure you have the best possible experience!
