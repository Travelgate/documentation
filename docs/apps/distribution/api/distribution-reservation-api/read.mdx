# Read

This method allows retrieving complete information about reservations primarily based on locators filters, returning complete information for each matching reservation. Please be aware that only 50 reservations can be retrieved at once; requesting more than this limit will result in an error.

## Request

**Mandatory criteria:**

To make a read, it is essential to set either a tgxLocators, providerLocators and clientsLocators, but not all three at the same time (as this will result in an error). 

**Optional criteria:**

Optionally, you can filter your read by specifying specific searchCancellationsCorrelationID. You can also choose to filter by isTest.

```html
{
    "access" : {
        "accessToken" : "xxxx",
        "user" : "xxxx",
        "password" : "xxxx"
    },
    "tgxLocators" : [
        "123"
    ]
}
```

### Request Data Breakdown

| Element				| Rel | Type	| Description					|
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| access		| 1  |	node  | Acces information: <ul><li>It will be validated to grant acces to the API and to the operation.</li><li>If there is any problem then an error will be returned.</li></ul>
| access/accessToken 		| 1  |	string  | Key to acces to the API.
| access/user        		| 1  |	string  | User.
| access/password    		| 1  |	string  | Password related to the user.
| tgxLocators    		    |0..N|list(string)| TGX locators to search for.
| providerLocators    		|0..N|list(string)| Provider locators to search for.
| clientLocators    		|0..N|list(string)| Agency/Client locators to search for.
| correlationIDs    		|0..N|list(string)| CorrelationIDs to search for.
| isTest                    | 0,1| boolean  | Test mode:<ul><li>If set to **_true_** the operation will be executed in "*test mode*". This means that the response will include dummy information (no real reservations information).</li><li>If not set to **_true_** or not given then the operation will execute as normally.</li></ul> *In order to test the API, we still need to give a real access information. Note that even in test mode all operations will execute its own request validations, so the requests must be well formed.*
