# How to Assign Roles by Service

You can assign different roles to users for specific services within your Organization. Here’s how:

1. Click the **three dots** next to the user and select **Modify services permissions**. This feature is only available to **Admins** or **Owners**.
2. Choose the **services** you want the user to access.
3. Assign roles for each service as needed.
