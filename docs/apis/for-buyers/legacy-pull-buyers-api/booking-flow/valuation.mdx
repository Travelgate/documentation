:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

:::

# Valuation

Valuation operation evaluates the rate before reservation, providing the same information as the Avail response for a hotel rate, including up-to-date pricing. Additionally, it offers further details such as rate breakdown and cancellation policies. The returned fields include: `Status`, `Price`, `CancelPenalities`, `Fees`, `PaymentOptions` etc.

:::caution

The amount of information returned might vary between Sellers.

:::

## Valuation Request

:::caution Suppliers with block allotment

There are some suppliers who use block allotments, sometimes called pre-confirmation or quote. In that case, you will have 30 minutes to complete the booking, if not, you will have to re-launch Valuation 30 minutes after the last request, normally just before booking request.

## Valuation Response

After each request, the Seller will process the data and provide you with a response. Upon receiving a `Valuation` request, the Seller will send you a corresponding `Valuation` response. 

The response options include either **success** or an **error**. In the event of success, the valuation response will provide you with updated information about the option you selected during the avail step.

| CancelPenalty/Penalty     | 1          |          | This value represents the penalty amount that will be applied. Normally, it is the amount our client must pay without commission (net). However, if the supplier does not return the net amount during the booking and cancellation flow, and only provides the price with commission included (gross), then the penalty will also be calculated as gross. Some suppliers do not specify whether they work with net or gross prices. In those cases, Travelgate tries to detect it and applies the value that matches the one returned in the cancellation policy. The main goal is to keep consistency with the type of prices the supplier provides throughout the whole booking and cancellation process. |
