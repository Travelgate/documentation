# How to Submit a Case

If you've ever submitted a Tech Support case, you know how important it is to stay updated on its status. At Travelgate, we have a structured process to ensure your case is handled efficiently and effectively. When you submit a case through our [Support Portal](https://app.travelgate.com/support), here’s what you can expect:

## Support Portal Dashboard

- Access the **Support Portal Dashboard** by clicking the **ticket icon** in the upper-right corner of the screen, next to the bell icon.
- The dashboard provides an **overview of all open cases** for both your user and your company, organized into different tabs.
- You can **sort cases** by status, creation date, or update date, and view or close cases via **“Actions > View Case”** or **“Actions > Close Case.”**
- **Filters**: Use the left panel to filter by **Case ID, name, or category**.
- If you've reviewed the [Guidelines for Opening a Case](/kb/platform/support-portal/case-guidelines) and [AIna User Guide](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/support-resources/aina-user-guide) but still need help, click **'Create New Case'** and follow the form instructions.

:::info Case Categories 💡
- **Customer Care:** Covers [product maintenance](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/support-resources/customer-support-resources) and minor Seller API updates.
- **Connections:** Generated for new connection requests.
- **Billing:** For billing-related support.

## AIna and Customer Support Cases

When you click **'Create New Case'**, the following happens:

1. **AIna Support Screen**: Enter your issue in the subject and provide a *detailed description* (include snippets, method used, error descriptions, etc.). This enables our virtual assistant, AIna, to potentially resolve your issue more quickly, and ensures our support team has all the necessary information to assist you effectively if further help is needed. **Refer to our [AIna User Guide](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/support-resources/aina-user-guide) for best practices**.  

   Click **“Continue”**, and AIna will search the Knowledge Base and Documentation for solutions.

   - **“Yes, it solved my issue”** – No need to create a case.
   - **“Go back and rephrase your question”** – Refine your request for better results, and don’t hesitate to rephrase your question for extra clarity!💡
   - **“No, I still need help. Show me more options”** – Proceed to create a case with additional details for our support team. If you proceed to create a case, ensure all issue categories are correct and include all relevant details and information to expedite resolution.
