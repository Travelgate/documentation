# Categories

The Categories Query returns a comprehensive hotel categories list from a supplier's access that may include translations to other languages, granting you access to all the categories configured by the Seller for a given set of credentials. The returned fields include:

* `categoryCode`
* `text`
* `language`


## Query Overview

When creating your categories query, you have 1 input to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria

### 1. Criteria    

This query offers versatility, with certain fields marked as mandatory (`access`) and others as optional (`categoryCodes` and `group`). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Categories Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. Consequently, the response will only include information that is highly relevant to you, streamlining the retrieval process and ensuring the data you receive meets your exact requirements.

**Mandatory criteria**
* `access`

**Optional criteria**
* `categoryCodes` (Search by category type)
* `group`


### Response Considerations

:::note

The amount of information and content returned might vary between Sellers.

Hotel-X supports all languages, but receiving categories descriptions in one or another depends entirely on the languages supported by the Seller.

:::

#### Mapping

When utilizing the Categories List Query, you will receive the Seller's native categories codes. Connecting with a new Seller doesn't always mean that you are interested in the whole categories portfolio, maybe you are just interested in some specific categories. Since mapping depends entirely on your side, you can map only those categories you are interested in.

Additionally, you can upload your own mapping files to our FTP (credentials should be provided by our Customer Care team), and we will use your own categories codes in the booking flow.

You can find all the necessary information in the [mapping section](../plugins/mapping.mdx).

## Examples

#### Search for the complete categories list from a supplier

<GraphqlSample query={categoriesQuery} variables={categoriesVariables} />


#### Search for a specific category code from a supplier

When utilizing the Categories List Query, for more personalized results, filter specific categories based on your interests. For example, to focus solely on the 4\* (four stars) inventory of a Seller, add the `categoryCodes` field with "4" and "5" (these are the codes that this Seller has assigned for the 4\* categories) in your criteria. This will provider you with highly targeted and relevant information.
