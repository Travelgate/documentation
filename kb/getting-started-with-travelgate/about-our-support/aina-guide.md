# AIna User Guide

Welcome to your guide on getting the most out of [AIna](/kb/getting-started-with-travelgate/about-our-support/aina), our multilingual Customer Support Assistant! Whether you're troubleshooting an issue or seeking information, effective communication is key to a smooth and productive interaction. This article will equip you with actionable tips and techniques to engage with AIna confidently and efficiently, ensuring your questions are answered accurately and swiftly.

So, let's dive in and unlock the full potential of your AIna experience!🚀

### Clarity is Key
- Clearly state the reason for your inquiry and what prompts you to contact support. Formulate your queries in full sentences to help AIna comprehend your intent (purpose) better and respond accurately.
- Always specify any errors you encounter to ensure AIna’s response addresses your issue.
- If provided, ensure logs are properly referenced and relevant to your question. 
- When interacting with AIna through the Support Cases section, be sure to provide all relevant details in the **"Description"** field, as AIna relies on this information rather than the "Subject".

### Use Specific Keywords
Include specific terms or keywords related to your inquiry to help AIna find the most relevant information. These can include, but are not limited to:
- The API in use (e.g. Hotel-X, Channel-X, Inventory, etc.).
- The method (e.g. Search, Quote, Hotels, etc.).
- Whether you are a member of a Buyer or Seller Organization.
- The APP or solution being used (Inventory, Distribution).
- Any specific error messages encountered (if any).

### Break Down Complex Queries
Divide complex questions into smaller, more manageable parts to facilitate accurate responses.

### Provide Context and Avoid Assumptions
Offer necessary background information, such as the specific service or feature involved, to clarify your inquiry. Do not assume AIna is aware of past interactions. Provide full details each time you start a conversation.

### Follow Up and Clarify
Don't worry if the answer doesn't completely resolve your query—feel free to ask again! Also, when engaging with AIna via the [Support Cases](/kb/tickets/travelgatex-tickets#aina-and-customer-support-cases) section, you can always refine your question or request further details by clicking on **“Go back and rephrase your question”** at the top of the response. This option allows you to clarify your inquiry or cover additional points for greater clarity.

### AIna: Your Support Ally
AIna is your go-to resource for quick answers and guidance on troubleshooting errors. While it can't modify platform settings or access Partner account details and tickets, it excels at directing you on how to review or change your account information effectively. Let AIna help you navigate the platform with ease!


## Interacting with AIna: Dos and Don’ts💡

### Case 1

**Correct Example:**

"Hello AIna, I'm trying to make a booking in Hotel-X Pull Buyers API but I'm getting a 102 error - Provider error message in Book response. I've checked our configuration but couldn't find the reason. Could you help me look into this? The specific error message I'm receiving is: [insert complete error information/snippet here]."

- The question is clear and concise, providing specific context (API used, method), detailing any efforts made to resolve the issue independently, sharing the exact error message, and mentioning relevant logs (provided).

**Incorrect Example:**

"Hello! I'm trying to do a booking, but I'm getting an error message. I have checked our configuration and couldn't find the reason. Can you take a look?"

- The question lacks important details and context that AIna needs to understand and effectively address the query (e.g., no information regarding the error, the method by which you detected it, or the API or solution you are using).

### Case 2

**Correct Example:**

"Hello AIna, I need an update on case ID 38272xxxx08432903. Could you guide me on how to access this information?"

- The question clearly explains the request, acknowledges that AIna might not have access to case details, and asks for the procedure to follow up.

**Incorrect Example:**

"I need info on case ID 38272xxxx08432903. What's the status?"

- This is a direct request for information without context or acknowledgment of AIna's access limitations.

### Case 3

**Correct Example:**

"Hello AIna, we're experiencing an issue with reservation statuses while using the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API. We receive 'Booking status: UN' in the reservation response and 'Booking status: OK' in the reservation read response. Could you help us ensure the information is consistent, either as OK or UN? Can you provide steps to rectify or clarify this, and additional information we should check?"

- The question details the issue with specific information, outlines the desired outcome, and requests guidance on the necessary actions to achieve that outcome, as well as any relevant documentation for their case.

**Incorrect Example:**

"We're getting conflicting messages on reservations. Can you fix this?"

- The question provides a generalized problem statement without specifics, limiting the ability to address it accurately. It also overlooks the fact that AIna cannot perform actions or make modifications on the platform.
