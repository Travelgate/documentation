## **Overview**

The `Search` operation is the entry point in the booking workflow, enabling clients to retrieve available options based on their specific requirements. It allows buyers to query for availability, pricing, and other relevant details about accommodations offered by the supplier.

The `Search` operation is used to:
- Fetch available options that match specific criteria provided by the client.
- Provide detailed information about available rooms, prices, and policies.
- Act as a foundation for subsequent operations like `Quote` and `Book`.

## **Request**

The Request is structured to accommodate various parameters that clients can specify to refine their search.

### **Overview**

Clients can define their search criteria to narrow down the available options. Common search parameters include:
- **Hotel Codes**: Specific properties to search within.
- **Occupations**: Number of guests, their ages, and nationalities.
- **Markets**: Specific geographic or demographic markets targeted by the client.
- **Check-in and Check-out Dates**: The desired date range for the stay.
