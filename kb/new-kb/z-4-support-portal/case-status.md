# Case Status Tracking

Once a support case is submitted, it goes through different statuses. Understanding these statuses helps you track progress and manage expectations.

## Customer Support Case Status

- **Open:** You receive an automatic confirmation with a reference number, subject, and description. You can add participants by clicking the "Cd" button in the reply box within Case Details.
- **In Progress:** A support agent is working on your case. If escalation is required, it will be sent to a Product team.
- **Partner's Feedback Required:** We are waiting for information from the Buyer or Seller.
  - A **reminder is sent after 3 days**, and another **after 5 days**.
  - If no response is received after **7 days**, the case will be **closed**.
- **Resolved:** You will receive an email with the solution. If you disagree, you have **7 days** to reopen it.
- **Closed:** Cases with no response for **7 days** in **Waiting on Buyer/Seller** or **after resolution** will be closed.
    - To reopen a closed case, click "Reopen Case". This generates a new Case ID, but all previous details remain intact. Click on the **new Case ID link** or refresh the page to view updates.

## New Connection Case Status

- **Pending Seller’s Feedback:** Awaiting additional information from the Seller.
- **Delivered:** The activation was successful, and credentials were provided.
- **Not Completed:** The activation was unsuccessful due to **cancellation** or **case duplication**.
