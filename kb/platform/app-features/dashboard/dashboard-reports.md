:::info GMV and TTV
- **GMV (Gross Market Value)**: For a Travelgate Partner, GMV stands for "Gross Market Value". Similar to the general definition in B2B contexts, it refers to the total sales value of all transactions processed through the Travelgate Platform. This metric is crucial for partners as it indicates the volume of business conducted via the Platform, reflecting the scale and financial performance of the partnership.
- **TTV (Total Transaction Value)**: For a Travelgate Partner, TTV stands for "Total Transaction Value." It refers to the total value of sales transactions over a certain period, including the sum of all transactions processed through our platform. TTV is an important measure as it reflects the overall volume of business conducted via Travelgate.
