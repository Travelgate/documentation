# Virtual Credit Card

The Virtual Credit Card plugin allows you to connect with a VCC supplier who can create virtual credit cards for you at the time of reservation. For each hotel booking where you indicate the plugin, our system will connect with your VCC supplier to obtain the virtual credit card and use this information to complete the reservation with the hotel supplier.

Virtual Credit Card plugin adds the possibility to:

* **Create a virtual credit card (VCCGen):** The VCC generator plugin empowers Buyers to generate virtual credit cards featuring activation and expiration dates of their choosing. You can apply rules using the `genvcc.csv` rules file to determine whether or not to utilize a specific VCC. This decision is based on the rules defined within the file and the parameters specified in the request.

* **Cancel a virtual credit card (VCCCan):** The VCC cancel plugin is responsible for cancelling a virtual credit card identified by the id returned in the book response. The service will return the status of the payment card inside status field. This plugin should be utilized exclusively within the [Cancel](../booking-management/cancel) operation, contingent on the successful completion of the booking cancellation. To specify the virtual credit card to be used for cancellation, a rule that returns an access key will be employed, utilizing the same rule file as the VCC generator. You can establish rules within the `genvcc.csv` rule file to determine the utilization of a particular VCC based on rules within the file and request parameters.


:::warning Bear in mind
You need to have an agreement with a VCC supplier integrated with Travelgate to start using this plugin. Please check our [VCC Payments article](/kb/faqs/faqs-price/vcc-payments) to learn all the steps before configuring the plugin in your book mutations.
:::


To get started with the VCC plugin, follow these simple steps:

##  1.Create and Upload your GenVCC File

To get started, create your credit card file in the correct format and then upload it to your SFTP account. We've provided a template file below ‚¨áÔ∏è to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your own rules, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your SFTP.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

üìÅHotelX  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅHotelX_0000  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅBusinessRules  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **üìÑ[RequestContext_sequential_genvcc.csv](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/RequestContext_sequential_genvcc.csv)**

</BrowserWindow>
```

:::note

If you need assistance with requesting your credentials to access the SFTP server, determining the endpoint and directory format, or learning how to upload, update, and delete SFTP files, please refer to the [overview](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/overview) section of Plugins.

### File format specification

* **File Name:** RequestContext_sequential_genvcc.csv
* **Directory:** HotelX/HotelX\_0000/BusinessRules
* **Delimiter:** Comma (`,`)
* **Header Row:**
    * **IdRule:** Rule‚Äôs identifier
    * **ClientToken:** List of clientTokens allowed for this rule
    * **NoClientToken:** List of clientTokens not allowed for this rule
    * **Supplier:** List of hotel suppliers allowed for this rule
    * **NoSupplier:** List of hotel suppliers not allowed for this rule
    * **Hotels:** List of hotels for this rule which codes are in request context (Buyer or Supplier)
    * **NotHotels:** List of hotels not allowed for this rule which codes are in request context (Buyer or Supplier)
    * **Access:** List of accesses allowed for this rule
    * **NoAccess** List of accesses not allowed for this rule
    * **Currencies:** List of currencies allowed for this rule
    * **NoCurrencies** List of currencies not allowed for this rule
    * **CardType:** The CardType to be utilized for generating the virtual credit card
    * **VccAccess** Payment access used to generate the virtual credit card with the VCC supplier


:::info File Name
"RequestContext" on the file name depends on the context you use in your query:
* If you use your own Buyer context (multi mode search) you only need to load 1 file with your context in the name (BuyerContext_sequential_commission.csv).
* If you use the Supplier context (single mode search) you will need to load 1 file for each supplier with the Supplier context in the name (SupplierContext_sequential_commission.csv).

Also, if you include rules inside the file to use one VCC access or another for different hotel codes, those hotel codes should be indicated in the context of the file (Buyer or Supplier).
:::

:::note

All lists are represented as a unique string separated by semicolons (';'). Each element within a list is a distinct value relevant to the specific criterion. For instance, a list of permissible currencies may include multiple currency codes, and each currency code is separated by a semicolon within the string representation.
Example: 
    Currency list => "EUR;USD;MXN" 

<a id="listCardType"></a>

:::caution

Bear in mind that this file is a collection of rules and we chose in every Book **the first rule that matches the criteria sent in the Query**. You should specify the more restrictive rules on the top of the file. If there is no value for any rule criteria row, it means that any value in the request matches this row. It is important to indicate the contexts used in values on the rule criteria to improve rule matching.

## 2. Execute Virtual Credit Card Plugin in your Mutation

### GenVCC

Once you've uploaded your genvcc file, to use the plugin add the following field to the `settings` node of your request. Note that genvcc plugin can just be executed in `book` `mutation`. In order to successfully execute the genvcc plugin, you will need to create the request with the following variables.

* **`step`**: "REQUEST"
* **`type`**: "PRE_STEP"
* **`name`**: "genvcc"
* **`parameters`**:


| Key              | Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Default Value (if not sent)                                     | Mandatory |
|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `activationDate` | yyyy/mm/dd    | Represents the date when the virtual credit card will be activated                                                                                                       | Same day as the book                                            | NO        |
| `expirationDate` | yyyy/mm/dd    | Represents the date when the virtual credit card will expire                                                                                                             | One month after check in                                        | NO        |
| `useGross`       | true or false | Indicates that the amount to load onto the VCC will be the reservation value. If true, the gross value will be used; if false, the net value will be used. Not compatible with the 'amount' parameter. | Net reservation price value                                              | NO        |
| `amount`         | two decimals  | If you do not want to load the VCC with the reservation value and prefer to specify an exact amount, use this parameter. Not compatible with the 'useGross' parameter. If not provided, 'useGross' will be used based on the reservation price; if neither is indicated, the net reservation value will be used.          | Net reservation price value (if 'useGross' is not also sent) | NO        |


```js
"settings": {
    "plugins" : [
        {
            "step" : "REQUEST",
            "pluginsType" : {
                "type" : "PRE_STEP",
                "name" : "genvcc",
                "parameters" : [
                    {
                        "key" : "activationDate",
                        "value" : "yyyy-mm-dd"
                    },
                    {
                        "key" : "expirationDate",
                        "value" : "yyyy-mm-dd"
                    },
                    {
                        "key" : "useGross",
                        "value" : "true"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

:::danger

Please note, if your reservation fails due to connection or supplier error, a VCC (Virtual Credit Card) might still be created. If you need to cancel this VCC, contact with your VCC supplier promptly.

:::

### CanVCC

In the case of canvcc, since it is a cancellation, there is no need to upload any file. You just have to indicate it in the request. Please note that the canvcc plugin can only be executed in the `cancel` `mutation`. To successfully execute the canvcc plugin, you will need to create the request with the following variables.

* **`step`**: `RESPONSE`
* **`type`**: `POST_STEP`
* **`name`**: `canvcc`
* **`parameters`**:
    * **`id`**: The id of the virtual credit card that you want to cancel.
    * **`currency`**: (Optional) A currency can be added. This is particularly useful if you use different VCC accesses depending on the currency used. Currency code format must be ISO4217 code format (i.e. ‚ÄúEUR‚Äù, ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù, ‚ÄúGBP‚Äù,‚Ä¶)

:::caution Currency parameter when cancel VCC

Although it is optional, if you have VCC rules related to a currency, you must include this parameter when canceling to ensure the correct rule is applied and to avoid further issues.

:::

```js
"settings" : {
    "plugins" : [
        {
            "step" : "RESPONSE",
            "pluginsType" : {
                "type" : "POST_STEP",
                "name" : "canvcc",
                "parameters" : [
                    {
                        "key" : "id",
                        "value" : "virtualCreditCardID"
                    },
                    {
                        "key" : "currency",
                        "value" : "USD"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
## 3. Grahql mutation API 

In some cases, an error may occur during the booking process of Hotel-X. This can result in a virtual credit card (VCC) being created even though the hotel reservation was not successfully completed.

To handle this scenario, clients can use the provided GraphQL API to cancel the VCC on their own.


### Cancel 
The cancel operation allows you to cancel virtual credit card made during booking process of Hotel-X. The returned fields include:

* `status`
* `id`
* `type`

### Mutation Overview

When creating your cancel query, you have two different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings

```graphql
mutation {
    payX {
        cancel(
            input: {}
            settings: {}
        )
	}
}
```

### 1. Input

In this mutation the virtual credit card id is mandatory to able to identify which card we have to cancel"

```js
{
    "input" : {
        "virtualCreditCardId" : "123456789"
    }
}
```

### 2. Settings

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. By default, we apply the same configuration to all Hotel-X clients.
All fields are mandatory.

```js
{
	"settings": {
		"accessCode": "0",
		"clientName": "hotxdoc"
	}
}
```

### Response 
The response of cancel mutation will return below fields:

* `status`
* `id`
* `type`

#### Id
The unique identifier provide by VCC provider to identify virtual credit card

#### Cancel Status

Once a Cancel method is run, our API response will provide its cancel status. This status represents the current status of the cancellation and can be categorized into four possible values:

| Status       | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CANCELED`   | The VCC is cancelled.                                                                                                                                            |
| `CREATED`    | The VCC status is OK, is not cancelled.                                                                                                                          |
| `EXPIRED`    | The VCC status is expired.                                                                                                                                       |
| `ACTIVE`     | The VCC status is OK, is not cancelled.                                                                                                                          |
| `UNKNOWN` | During the cancelation process, an issue led to an unknown status. The Buyer is responsible for confirming with the VCC provider that the VCC has been canceled. |
