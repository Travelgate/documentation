# Hotels

The Hotels Query allows you to retrieve hotel information in two ways:  
- The **FastX Hotel Master**, a unified list of all unique hotels available to you in the Travelgate Marketplace. These FastX codes are the ones used throughout the booking flow.  
- The **Supplier Hotel List**, which provides the native hotel information returned directly by each connected Seller.

This flexibility lets you work with both standardized FastX codes for a seamless integration and the original Supplier data when you need full visibility into each Partner’s portfolio.

The returned fields include:

* `hotelCode`
* `hotelName`
* `giataData`
* `location`
* `allAmenities`
* `medias`
* `descriptions`

## Query Overview

When creating your hotels query, you have three different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Token

### 1. Criteria 

This query offers versatility, with certain fields marked as mandatory (`access`) and others as optional (`hotelCodes`, `countries`, `destinationCodes`, etc.). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Hotels Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. Consequently, the response will only include information that is highly relevant to you, streamlining the retrieval process and ensuring the data you receive meets your exact requirements.

```js
{
	"criteriaHotels": {
		"access": "2",
		"hotelCodes": [
			"91415"
		],
		"maxSize": 5
	}
}
```

**Mandatory criteria**
* `access`

**Optional criteria**
* `hotelCodes` (Search by hotel)
* `countries` (Search by country)
* `destinationCodes` (Search by destination)
* `ranks`
* `maxSize` (Paginate response)
* `language` (It requests the language in format "ISO 639-1 lowercase", in case of having information stored in that language, it will return the answer in the requested language.)


### 2. Token

The Hotel-X API provides paginated responses to handle cases where the number of hotels from the selected supplier exceeds 10000. The default response page contains a maximum of 500 hotels, but you can specify the number of objects returned per page using the `maxSize` field in the criteria variable explained before to retrieve between 1 and 10000 hotels.

To include the token in your request, all you need to do is:

1. Add the `token` object to the fields and variables. 

2. After receiving a response, you will only receive a portion of the full list. To access the next page, simply copy the `token` tag from the response and include it in your next request. This will allow you to obtain a new set of objects in the following response.

3. Repeat these steps until the `token` is no longer included in the response, the query will return “Hotels not found”.

**Query variables**

First, in your hotels query you won't indicate any `token` input:

```js
{
    "criteriaHotels" : {
        "access" : "2",
        "maxSize" : 5
    },
    "token" : ""
}
```

You will obtain a response with 5 hotels per page:

**Response**

```js
{
	"data": {
		"hotelX": {
			"hotels": {
				"token": "FGluY2x1ZGVfY29udGV4dF91dWlkDnF1ZXJ5VGhlbkZldGNoAhZMN2w2SlZYaVNaaXhYeXQwdm1GWjlBAAAAAAV14HUWeXZ3cU02MkpSbTY3WkF6QzJraWJWZxY2NDJ0Uk1EUFFkZXZZTS1ENDVTd2tBAAAAAAZuWSgWdFZSMzRYUVBUWC1nZ1ltWVRCTjVMZw==",
				"edges": [
					{
						"..."
					}
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This token should be used as input in your next hotels query, inside the `token` input:


```js
{
    "criteriaHotels" : {
        "access" : "2",
        "maxSize" : 5
    },
    "token" : "FGluY2x1ZGVfY29udGV4dF91dWlkDnF1ZXJ5VGhlbkZldGNoAhZMN2w2SlZYaVNaaXhYeXQwdm1GWjlBAAAAAAV14HUWeXZ3cU02MkpSbTY3WkF6QzJraWJWZxY2NDJ0Uk1EUFFkZXZZTS1ENDVTd2tBAAAAAAZuWSgWdFZSMzRYUVBUWC1nZ1ltWVRCTjVMZw=="
}
```


### Response Considerations

:::note

The amount of information and content returned might vary between Sellers.

Hotel-X supports all languages, but receiving hotel descriptions in one or another depends entirely on the languages supported by the Seller.

## Returned Fields

<HotelConnection />


## Examples

#### Search for the FastX master hotel list for all your connected suppliers

You should use your FastX access in order to obtain the hotel list master:

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsQuery} variables={hotelsFastXVariables} />


#### Search for a specific country

When utilizing the Hotels List Query, for more personalized results, filter specific hotels, countries or destinations based on your interests. For example, to focus solely on the inventory of all your Sellers in Greece, add the `countries` field with "GR" in your criteria. This will ensure you receive hotels directly related to that country, providing you with highly targeted and relevant information.

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsQuery} variables={hotelsByCountryVariables} />


#### Search for a specific hotel code

If you want to retrieve the information of specific hotel codes, you will need to specify the codes in the `hotelCodes` field:

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsQuery} variables={hotelsByHotelCodeVariables} />


#### Search for the complete hotel list from a specific supplier

To obtain only the portfolio of a specific access you should include in the query the access of that specific supplier, for example access '2' for Travelgate Test supplier.
.

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsQuery} variables={hotelsVariables} />


#### Search for a specific destination from a specific supplier

For example, if you want to obtain only hotels from "Santorini", you can use the destination code for that zone. In the bellow case, test supplier have determined code "101402" as Santorini, so you need to specify this code in the `destinationCodes` field:

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsQuery} variables={hotelsByDestinationCodeVariables} />
