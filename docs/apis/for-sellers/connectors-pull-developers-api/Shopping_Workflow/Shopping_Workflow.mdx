## Shopping Workflow

The shopping workflow consists of all operations required to perform and manage a booking. It ensures seamless communication between buyers and suppliers, enabling real-time searches, quotes, bookings, and post-booking management. These operations form the backbone of the integration, allowing buyers to access supplier data in a standardized format.

All these operations can be implemented in the connector, providing flexibility and scalability to meet varying supplier and buyer requirements. Some operations, like `CheckBookings`, are optional but highly recommended, as their absence may reduce buyer confidence or limit functionality, potentially discouraging buyers from using the connector.
