# How to Edit an Access

To **edit or update an access**, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the "My Connections" screen and filter the access you wish to edit.
2. Click the three dots (action menu) on the right side of the access entry.
3. From the drop-down menu, select **Edit Access**.
4. You'll see your current credentials for that access. Modify the details as needed (only editable fields are available for modification).

### Connections via Legacy Pull Buyers API

If you are working with connections established through the Legacy Pull Buyers API, please note that updates to credentials (such as Hotel-X Access Codes) must be made in two places:

1. **My Connections** – Edit the access at the access level.
2. **Buyer's System** – Update the legacy configuration stored on the buyer's end to ensure consistency across both systems.

Simply updating the Hotel-X Access Code in My Connections will not be sufficient.

As a Seller, you can check if your Buyers are using the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API by inspecting the label on their Buyer card in the [My Connections](https://yoururl.com/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/managing-connections/connections-details#what-can-i-find-in-my-connections) section.
