# Safety Margin

Safety Margin plugin allows discarding options that have a commission lower than expected. Only options that have a commission over gross, equal or lower than those reported in the file will be returned. 

The expected commission has to be loaded in a safety-margin file. Sequentially, the rules will be evaluated until a match is found, upon finding it, the process will be stopped and the commission will be evaluated. In the same way, if the rule is not found, the option will be validated.

The matching process uses the `clientTokens` field, which identify the provided by the client and it is used to filter which business rules can be applied in the request sent.

To get started with the Preference plugin, follow these simple steps:
