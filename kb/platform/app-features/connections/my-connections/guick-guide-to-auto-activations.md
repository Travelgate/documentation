# Quick Guide to Auto-Connections

This guide will walk you through the process of requesting a connection with one of our Partners via the Travelgate Marketplace. We aim to make this process as straightforward and seamless as possible, helping you connect with Partners and enhance your business opportunities.

Our goal has always been to make connecting with a Partner easier and faster.

:::info Keep in mind:
- **Having a commercial contract with Travelgate** is essential to request a new connection.
- **Activations of connections with Channel Managers via Travelgate** should always be requested by the Buyers, not the Channel Managers themselves.

## How Can I Request a New Connection?

1. **Log into** [our Platform](https://www.travelgate.com/).

2. **Navigate to "Connections" > "My Connections"**. Ensure you're logged into the correct Organization and Partner profile (Buyer or Seller). You can find this information in the top right corner of your screen.

3. **Click "Create a New Connection"** to begin the process.
    - **Step 1 (Partner)**: Select the Partner you want to connect with. Some Sellers may offer multiple connection types ([Pull or Push](/kb/welcome-to-travelgate/connectivity-services/pull-and-push-connectivity)), so choose the one that fits your needs.

    - **Step 2 (Access Configuration)**: Assign a distinctive name for your access (e.g., B2B or B2C). Indicate whether it’s for testing or live use. Then, complete the form with the credentials provided by the Seller.

        *Remember*: Each Seller may require different information, depending on their system’s specifications. Make sure your credentials are active and fully functional before proceeding, as using inactive credentials can cause delays.

    - **Step 3 (Notification Setup)**: Choose where you'd like to receive notifications once the activation is processed.

    - **Step 4 (Review and Confirm)**: Double-check your information before starting the auto-activation process. If you and your Partner have a Commercial Agreement for 2023, the form will show available payment types:
        - **FREE**: No cost to you. Your Partner will cover the connectivity fee.
        - **STD**: Standard booking fees apply for both you and your Partner.
        - **SUP**: Both standard fees and supplements apply to you, but it's free for your Partner.

    Once complete, you'll receive an email with all the details to activate the connection. You can also monitor the activation status in the "My Connections" section.


:::tip I haven’t received the confirmation email for the credentials I requested. What should I do?  
If you haven’t received the confirmation email, follow these steps:
1. **Check Activation Status**: Verify the status of the activation ticket and ensure the requested credential is marked as 'active' in the 'My Connections' section.
2. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**: Sometimes, confirmation emails end up in your spam folder.
3. **Review Email Settings**: If the email isn't in your spam folder, there may be an issue with your email notification settings.
4. **Contact Support**: If you still haven't received the email, contact Travelgate Support for assistance.

|---------------------------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Working**             | Your access is ready and working! Please wait for the email from our activations team confirming that your credentials are ready before opening your feed. |
| 🟡 **In Progress**         | The automatic setup is still in process, but it will be ready soon. If there’s an issue, our team will intervene and update you. |
| 🔵 **Partner's feedback required** | We’re waiting for additional details from either the Seller or Buyer to proceed. |
