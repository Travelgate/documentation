# Recommend Helpers

To facilitate complex points in the Connector, the `IConnectorsUtilities` class provides several helpful utilities. These helpers simplify common tasks and ensure adherence to Travelgate standards.

---

## **Utilities Overview**

### **OptionsFromRoomsGenerator**
This utility is particularly useful in the `Search` operation for suppliers that return rooms instead of pre-made options. Since Travelgate operates with options, this generator accumulates rooms and applies business rules to generate valid options.

> **Use Case**: Recommended when the supplier provides rooms without combining them into options.

### **IOptionsGenerator**
Similar to `OptionsFromRoomsGenerator`, this utility accumulates pre-made options provided by the supplier. It applies Travelgate's business rules to ensure compliance with Travelgate standards.

> **Use Case**: Recommended when the supplier already provides pre-made options in the response.

### **ICancelPenaltyManager**
Handles the transformation and management of supplier cancellation policies, ensuring compatibility with the standardized Travelgate format.

> **Use Case**: Essential for operations like `Quote` or `Cancel` to standardize cancellation policies provided by the supplier.

### **ICountryConverter**
Converts ISO country codes and names, facilitating compatibility between supplier-specific formats and standardized ISO formats.

> **Use Case**: Useful in `Search` or `Book` operations where supplier-specific country formats need to align with Travelgate standards.

### **IMetadataConnectorsService**
Provides access to metadata utilities, allowing retrieval of supplier metadata, business rule configurations, and other operational data required for processing requests.

> **Use Case**: Ideal for dynamic retrieval and use of metadata, enabling adaptable and consistent Connector operations.
