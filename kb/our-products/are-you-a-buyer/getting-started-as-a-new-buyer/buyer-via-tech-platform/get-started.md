### Step 4: Activate Sellers ✔️

Now, let's start by requesting connections. Just follow these [easy steps](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) to send the activation request.

You might have multiple credentials for a single connection, such as B2B and B2C credentials. In this case, we strongly recommend using clear names for easy identification. For example: SellerName_B2B.

As the Buyer, your task is to **request the technical configuration information from each Supplier** so you can configure the credentials.
