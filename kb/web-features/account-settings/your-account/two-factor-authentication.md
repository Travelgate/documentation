# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

:::warning Important
Starting from **September 10th, 2024,** our website requires 2FA for all users. Please be advised that we are no longer liable for any issues, losses, or damages arising from the use of shared accounts. To ensure uninterrupted access and maintain security, all users must have transitioned to individual accounts by this date. Non-compliance may result in service disruptions or restricted access.

## What Is Two-Factor Authentication?
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security feature that enhances account protection by requiring a secondary verification step in addition to your password when signing in.

A unique security code, known as a **One-Time Password (OTP)**, is generated each time you log in using an authenticator application. To use 2FA, you must have an authenticator app installed. We recommend **Google Authenticator**, but there are multiple options available:

### Recommended Authenticator APPs:
- **Mobile APPs:**
   - [Google Authenticator - Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)
   - [Microsoft Authenticator - Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)
