# HubStatus Codes and Errors

### What Are the Potential HubStatus Codes in a Method Response? 
- **HubStatus 1: OK** - The request has been successfully executed without any Hub errors.
- **HubStatus 2: EXCEPTION** - This code indicates that the request encountered an uncontrolled exception at the Hub level.
- **HubStatus 3: TIMEOUT** - The request encountered a timeout error. A HubStatus code of 3 means the Hub timeout set by the Buyer in their request was insufficient to parse the Seller's response.
- **HubStatus 4: UNDEFINED** - This code signifies that the request encountered an unspecified Hub error.

#### I Received a HubStatus 3 Error in My Legacy Pull Buyers API Response. What Can I Do? 
To prevent HubStatus 3 errors, ensure that the [Hub timeout](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/getting-started-with-hotel-x-buyers-api/timeout-settings#my-legacy-api-requests-contain-two-timeout-tags-what-distinguishes-one-from-the-other) set by the Buyer is **at least 300ms higher** than the provider timeout tag. This additional time allows for sufficient parsing of the Seller's response.
