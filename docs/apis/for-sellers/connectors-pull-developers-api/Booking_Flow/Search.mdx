## **Overview**

The `Search` operation is the entry point in the booking workflow, enabling clients to retrieve available options based on their specific requirements. It allows buyers to query for availability, pricing, and other relevant details about accommodations offered by the supplier.

The `Search` operation is used to:
- Fetch available options that match specific criteria provided by the client.
- Provide detailed information about available rooms, prices, and policies.
- Act as a foundation for subsequent operations like `Quote` and `Book`.

## **Cancellation Policies in Search**

Cancellation policies in the **availability (Search)** step are important because they allow buyers to know—right from the start—whether an option is **refundable** and under what conditions.

However, not all suppliers are required to provide cancellation policy details during the Search response. Some suppliers only include this information in the **Quote** step.

:::note
The cancellation policies shown in Search may differ from those shown in Quote.
This can happen because some suppliers do not return cancellation policies during the search phase, or because conditions may change between the two calls.
The valid and final cancellation policy will always be the one received in the Quote response.
This behavior is expected and should be taken into account.
:::

In such cases, the `refundable` field may appear as `null` in the Search response, indicating that the supplier will only provide cancellation information during the Quote phase.

To avoid confusion or incorrect assumptions, it is essential to check the supplier's metadata to understand what level of cancellation detail is provided at each stage of the booking flow.

:::tip
If `refundable` is `null` in the Search response, make sure to handle cancellation logic in the **Quote** step, where detailed policy data is guaranteed.
:::

For a complete reference on how cancellation policies should be handled in the Quote phase, see:

- [Internal Cancellation Policy Model](./Quote#internal-cancellation-policy-model)
- [Helpers for Mapping Supplier Data](./Quote#helpers-for-mapping-supplier-data)


## **Request**

The Request is structured to accommodate various parameters that clients can specify to refine their Search.

### **Overview**

Clients can define their Search criteria to narrow down the available options. Common Search parameters include:
- **Hotel Codes**: Specific properties to search within.
- **Occupations**: Number of guests, their ages, and nationalities.
- **Markets**: Specific geographic or demographic markets targeted by the client.
- **Check-in and Check-out Dates**: The desired date range for the stay.
