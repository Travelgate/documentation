# How to add a hotel to the Inventory Extranet

### How can I add a hotel to my Inventory SetUp?
Inventory's system works with its own **master hotel database** where we store all the basic information of the hotels configured by our Partners. To add a new hotel to your SetUp simply follow the steps below:

1. Access our Inventory Extranet.
2. Click on Inventory>SetUp (top menu).
3. Click on **+Add Hotel** and introduce the hotel name in the Autocomplete field. Our system will display all the properties that match your input.

If the hotel you require is not found within the autocomplete field, click on **"Create Hotel"** and provide the hotel's basic information to create it in our database:
