# Search

Search serves as the initial step in our booking flow, with the objective of verifying availability within the specified date range and for the requested number of guests, either for specific hotels or for hotels in the desired destination. It provides a comprehensive list of available options based on your search criteria. The returned fields include:

* `hotelCode`
* `hotelName`
* `boardCode`
* `paymentType`
* `occupancies`
* `rooms`
* `price`
* `rateRule`
* `cancelPolicy`
* `id`


## Search Inputs

When creating your search query, you have three different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings
3. Filter Search

```graphql
query {
    hotelX {
    search
      criteria: {}
      settings: {}
	  filterSearch: {}
	}
}
```

<CautionSettingsHotelX />

### 1. Criteria 

The search query offers versatility in search options, with certain fields marked as mandatory (`checkIn`, `checkOut`, `hotels` etc.) and others as optional (`language`, `currency`, `nationality` etc.). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Search Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. 

To specify your search criteria you need to use the input `HotelCriteriaSearchInput` in your query variables:

```js
{
	"criteriaSearch": {
		"checkIn": "2024-10-28",
		"checkOut": "2024-10-29",
		"occupancies": [
			{
				"paxes": [
					{
						"age": 30
					},
					{
						"age": 30
					}
				]
			}
		],
		"hotels": [
			"1",
            "2"
		],
		"currency": "EUR",
		"market": "ES",
		"language": "es",
		"nationality": "ES"
	}
}
```

**Mandatory criteria:**
* `checkIn` (yyyy-mm-dd)
* `checkOut` (yyyy-mm-dd)
* `hotels` (We recommend a maximum of 200 hotel codes per request.)
* `destinations` (Only if you use the [Search by destination plugin](../plugins/search-by-destination) and you don't use the `hotels` field.)
* `occupancies` (For multi-room bookings, this array will contain multiple elements, each representing a room, and you'll need to provide occupancy details for each requested room.)

**Optional criteria:**
* `language`
* `currency`
* `nationality`
* `markets`

### 2. Settings 

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. You need to specify some in your query or mutation, while others are optional. If you skip the optional ones, we'll use default settings to keep your requests consistent and smooth.

To specify your settings you need to use the [`HotelSettingsInput` input](/api/inputs/hotel-settings-input) in your query variables:

```js
{
	"settings": {
		"client": "client_demo",
		"context": "HOTELTEST",
		"testMode": true,
        "auditTransactions": false,
		"timeout": 5000
	}
}
```

**Mandatory Settings:**
* `client`
* `context` (You have the flexibility to choose between using the supplier's context or your own, depending on which hotel codes you want to use in the query input. If you choose to search for different suppliers using the same query, you must use your own context code and mapping functionality.)
* `timeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for all supplier connections. Won't close Buyer connection if exceeded.)

**Optional Settings:**
* `group`
* `auditTransactions` 
* `suppliers` (Each one contains its own code, settings and accesses.)
* `plugins`
* `testMode` (This flag allows only the accesses checked as test.)
* `businessRules`
* `clientTokens` (Used to identify the origin of the request, this is only used with some [plugins](../plugins/overview).)
* `operationTimeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for Hotel-X connection. Will close Buyer connection if exceeded. Must be higher than `timeout`.)

:::tip Key Recommendations

* Customize the `timeout` according to your needs, taking into consideration **the maximum value in Search is 25,000ms**.

* Set the `auditTransaction` to "false" in Search for better performance.

:::


:::caution Using your own context and mapping functionality

To request hotel availability using your own hotel codes, utilize the [Hotel-X mapping feature](../plugins/mapping). You can achieve this by uploading your mapping files to your FTP account. This approach enables you to make requests with your unique context codes and receive results from all your Sellers with your custom hotel codes.

:::


### 3. Filter Search

Filters allow you to precisely tailor the response according to your preferences. 

To specify your filters you need to use the input `HotelXFilterSearchInput` in your query variables. The available filters inside this input are:

* `rateRules`: This filter enables you to narrow down the options returned by the suppliers based on the desired rate rules you want to include or exclude.

* `status`: Use this filter to determine which status (OK and RQ) will be included or excluded in the response.

* `access`: By using the access filter, our system will exclusively include or exclude options from the selected accesses. If you choose not to set any access at all, requests will be made to all available accesses.


All these filters are optional. Example to request only search results from access "2" and options "PACKAGE" 


```js
{
    "filterSearch" : {
        "access" : {
            "includes" : [
                "2"
            ]
        },
        "rateRules" : {
            "includes" : [
                "PACKAGE"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

You would need to apply the same approach for filtering by specific rate rule (`rateRule`) and status (`status`).

### Requests Examples

#### Search query [1 hotel, 2 rooms: 3 adults 1 child]
<GraphqlSample query={searchQuickStartQuery} variables={searchTwoRoomsVariables}/>

#### Search query [2 hotels, 1 room: 2 adults]
<GraphqlSample query={searchQuickStartQuery} variables={searchMultipleHotelsVariables}/>


## Search Response

In the response to your search query, you'll receive all the available options that match your criteria. Each option provides various details, such as room type, price, and cancellation policies. 

:::tip Search output fields
Explore all the search results output fields and their descriptions in our detailed Graphql API Reference section [here](/api/objects/hotel-search/). 
:::


Here are some key points to keep in mind:

### Cancel Policies: Refundable Field

In the room structure response, there is a `refundable` field. If this field is set to false, it means the room has a 100% cancellation cost, making it non-refundable. If the field returns a null value, it indicates that the Seller doesn't provide this information at this stage and you will obtain this information in the quote step. 

:::caution Remember
Some Sellers may not include cancellation policies in their availability data. You can learn more about each Seller's specific details in their [metadata](../content/metadata).

    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Are there any limitations on the number of searches/minute?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>Not from Travelgate side, we don't have any limitations on the RPM ("Requests per Minute") in any of our methods. However, some Sellers may have some limitations so we suggest you contact directly with them in order to discuss this information.</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Does nationality or market affect the price returned?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>Yes, nationality and market might affect the rates received in Search response. This depends on the Seller so if you consider that you should get (or not) different rates depending on the nationality or market, please contact them directly.</div>
    </div>
</details>


<details>
<summary>How can I search in single or multi mode?</summary>
<p>You have the possibility to choose between searching in a single mode vs searching in a multi mode.</p>
<b>Singlemode search</b>
<p>The default mode in Hotel-X allows our Partners to perform one search per Seller connected to their account at a time.</p>

![Hotel-X Shopping Flow](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/hotel-x_single_mode.svg)

<p>When running your Search, you should add the Seller's access code you would like to query.</p>

```js
"filterSearch": {
    "access": {
        "includes": ["2"]
    }
}
```

<b>Multimode search</b>
<p>
    The multimode query allows our Partners to search multiple Sellers at the same time in just one request. To search
    in multimode, start by uploading your <a href="../plugins/mapping">hotel mapping files</a> to your FTP. Once the
    files are processed, you'll have the ability to search multiple Sellers simultaneously by using your own context
    and hotel codes.
</p>

![Hotel-X Shopping Flow](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/hotel-x_multi_mode.svg)

<p> 
    <b>1. Specifying the access codes in the filter node in your variables:</b> the query will only be sent to the accesses specified.
</p>

```js
"filterSearch": {
    "access": {
        "includes": ["2", "3"]
    }
}
```

<p>
    <b>2. Not specifying any accesses:</b> The query will be sent to all the accesses connected to your account (only the
    ones belonging to the Sellers where the mapping files has been uploaded). This
    query will also check the value of the "testMode" tag in order to request only the test or production accesses,
    accordingly.
</p>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why there are so many fields with null value in the Search response?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>The number of "null" values returned is determined by the information provided by Sellers. For example, if you include certain fields in your Search Query but the Seller does not have that information available on their side, the value will be returned in our response as "null".</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I filter the Hotel-X Search results by payment type?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>Unfortunately, Hotel-X API does not currently offer the capability to filter search results by payment type.</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How can I limit and filter options through optionsQuota and Business Rules?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>optionsQuota, how to limit the number of options in SearchRS:</b> Thanks to the optionsQuota tag,
                    you are able to control and limit the number of options per Mealplan returned in SearchRS in those
                    cases the Seller allows business rules (<i>you will be able to check this information through our Metadata Query</i>).
                    Note that we have established a system-level limit so that if the OptionsQuota set on your side is higher than the
                    limit established, we will use the one with the lowest value.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>
                    <b>businessRulesType, how to filter options through Business Rules:</b> These are the 2 types of businessRules that may be applied.
                    <ul>
                        <li>CHEAPER_AMOUNT: The cheapest options are returned without exceeding the optionsQuota limit.</li>
                        <li>ROOM_TYPE: It groups the options by room type without exceeding the optionsQuota limit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br></br>
                    Please note that options are filtered using a limited combination of rooms types. First, we group same room types so you receive options with the same type/classification. For example: Standard-Standard-Standard-Standard, Junior-Junior-Junior-Junior…. Then, we combine the cheapest rooms with the remaining rooms, always checking for duplicates and without execeeding the optionsQuota limit.
		            If a Buyer sets a BusinessRules value, then it will be applied when the number of options returned exceeds the optionsQuota. If the client does not set any BusinessRules values, then the CheaperAmount BusinessRule is applied by default.
