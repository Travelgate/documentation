# VCC Payments

## Paying Bookings with Virtual Credit Cards (VCC)

Travelgate supports multiple payment methods depending on the [payment type](/kb/faqs/faqs-price/travelgate-payment-types) returned by the supplier. If a booking requires a credit card payment, you have two options:

- **Using Your Own Credit Card**: If you obtain or generate your own credit card, provide the card details in the book mutation card input [`paymentCard`](/api/types/inputs/hotel-book-input), including the card type, number, CVC, and other relevant details.
- **Using a Virtual Credit Card (VCC) Provider**: If you do not generate your own VCCs, Travelgate integrates with several VCC suppliers that can create a virtual credit card for each booking. When requesting a VCC for payment, the system connects with your VCC provider to generate and apply the virtual card automatically.

## VCC Supplier Features

Our **VCC Generation Plugin** offers key functionalities to streamline virtual card payments:

1. **VccGen - Generate a Virtual Credit Card**  
   The [VCC Generator Plugin](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/virtual-credit-card) allows users to create VCCs with customizable activation and expiration dates. The system returns essential card details, including:
   - Cardholder name
   - Card number
   - CVC code
   - Expiration date
   - Card type (e.g., VI)

   Users can configure rules in the `genvcc.csv` file to determine when and how a VCC should be used. More details on the rules file can be found [here](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/virtual-credit-card#file-format-specification).

2. **VccCan - Cancel a Virtual Credit Card**  
   The [VCC Cancel Plugin](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/virtual-credit-card) enables cancellation of a VCC using the ID returned in the Book response. The cancellation status appears in the `paymentInfo` field. Rules in the `genvcc.csv` file can be configured to determine which VCCs should be canceled. More details on this process can be found [here](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/virtual-credit-card#file-format-specification).

3. **Create and upload your VCC Rules file** to your SFTP.
4. **Complete the VCC setup**:
