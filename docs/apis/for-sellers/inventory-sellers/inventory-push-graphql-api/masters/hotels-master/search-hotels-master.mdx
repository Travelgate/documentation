With this example, we are going to search for hotels that are located in a 10km radius from TravelgateX's office located in Palma de Mallorca. 

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsMasterSearchQuery} variables={hotelsMasterSearchVariables} />

#### Search for Hotel masters by their geolocation and filter by Hotel name

Now, we want to filter previous results by introducing the filter `hotelName` and we are trying to search for hotels that are close to the sea, so we will asume that some hotels have "mar" in their name.

<GraphqlSample query={hotelsMasterSearchQuery} variables={hotelsMasterSearchHotelNameVariables} />
