### SFTP Endpoint

```
sftp.xmltravelgate.com
```

### Directory Format

The structure of the directory should be in the below format, all files should be inside this directory:

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

üìÅF[Folder code]\_[Unique code]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅHotelX  _[Unique code]

</BrowserWindow>
```

F[Folder code]_[Unique code]
* Folder code: corresponds to the folder number.
* Unique code: corresponds to the folder unique code in our system.

HotelX_[Unique code]
* Unique code: corresponds to the Hotel-X unique code in our system.

Example: 

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

üìÅF0_1781  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅHotelX_1790

</BrowserWindow>
```

### Upload SFTP Data

To upload a file to the SFTP, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the File:**
   - Once you've decided on the plugin you want to use, and if it's necessary, simply upload the required CSV file.

2. **Wait for Processing:**
   - Once you've uploaded the file, our system will take care of the rest.
   - We'll automatically add the "_processed" tagline to the end of the file name when the processing is complete.

   For example, if you uploaded a file for hotel mapping plugin with the name:
   ```
   BuyerContext_SupplierContext_hotel_map_.csv
   ```

   After our system processes it, it will look like this:
   ```
   BuyerContext_SupplierContext_hotel_map_processed.csv
   ```

### Update SFTP Data

To update a file on the SFTP, follow these steps:

1. **Delete the Old File:** Remove the outdated file from the directory.
2. **Upload the Updated File:** Upload the new file with the updated information, ensuring you use the correct file name. There is no need to add "_processed" to the name. Once the file has been updated, you must open a ticket in the customer care portal "https://app.travelgate.com/support" to force the update of the new file.

That's it! Updating SFTP files is as easy as that.


### Delete SFTP Data

To delete all the information stored in our system, follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Prepare an empty file:**
   - Create a new file with empty content, including only the headers.
   - Ensure that the file structure, such as column headers, remains intact.

2. **Load the empty file in the SFTP folder.**

That's it! By replacing the existing data with an empty file containing headers only, you effectively delete all the information previously loaded into our system.
