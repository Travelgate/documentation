# Create Room Master

## Mutation Overview

The `createRoomMaster` mutation allows you to create a new room master in Inventory. The returned fields include:

* `id`
* `code`
* `name`

### 1. Criteria

When building your mutation, you need to provide the following input fields:

#### Mandatory Input
* `clientCode`
* `code`
* `name`

### 2. Settings

To build your `createRoomMaster` input, you need to provide your client code in the field `clientCode` and specify the `code` and `name` you wish to set for the new room type.

:::note
Your `ClientCode` can be retrieved from any Travelgate's access with a Channel Manager.  
See [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections) and click "Get form data" in the selected access. The code in `Password` is equivalent to the `ClientCode`.
:::

```js
{
  "input":{
    "clientCode": "CDOC",
    "code": "STD",
    "name": "Standard"
  }
}
```

### Response Considerations

The mutation returns the created room object along with success status and possible advise messages.

#### `RoomsRs` (*OBJECT*)
* `rooms` (*InventoryRoom*) - A collection of created rooms.
    * `id` (*Int*) - Unique identifier.
    * `code` (*String*) - Room code.
    * `name` (*String*) - Room name.
* `success` (*Boolean*) - Indicates if the operation was successful.
