# Connect to Channel Managers via Travelgate

### What to Expect When Connecting to a Channel Manager 

- **As a Buyer**, you can use our Inventory Extranet to create the setup and structure for hotels, rates, and rooms contracted with the Channel Manager/Hotels. The setup should align with the agreements made with each hotel. Additionally, you will have the ability to access and book inventory via our API.
- **The Channel Manager** will extract the codes for hotels, rates, and rooms created and map them to their data, enabling them to load availability and rates into our system.

### Activation and Configuration

Travelgate allows only **one credential (Hotel-X Access Code) per Channel Manager**. If you require multiple configurations, the Inventory Extranet offers flexible setup options to tailor your product settings efficiently.

### How to Connect to a Channel Manager 

1. **Log into Our Platform:** Note that to connect to a Channel Manager, you must be a registered Buyer on Travelgate.

2. **Explore Available Channel Managers:** Visit our [Network](https://app.travelgate.com/network/partners) and select the "Tech Platform > Channel Manager" category to view available options.

3. **Confirm Commercial Agreements:** Coordinate with both the hotel and the Channel Manager to finalize commercial agreements. Be sure to inform them that the connection will be made via Travelgate.

4. **Request Activation:** Submit your activation request through our Platform under "My Connections." A complete guide on how to request activation can be found [here](/kb/platform/app-features/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).

5. **Credentials Generation:** Once your request is processed, we will generate credentials for accessing the Inventory Extranet and finalize the activation with the Channel Manager.

6. **Access and Configuration:** Once activation is complete, we will provide the necessary access credentials and configuration settings to connect via API and use the Inventory Extranet.

7. **Learn with Travelgate Resources:** After gaining access, enhance your knowledge by watching [Travelgate Academy videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_nJoDkMOTA) and reviewing our [Extranet Documentation](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/overview) to get familiar with available features.

8. **Create a Pilot Hotel:** Set up a pilot hotel to perform product loading tests. For step-by-step instructions, refer to the ["Setup" section](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/overview) in our documentation. We recommend using a real hotel that you plan to work with, as this will simplify the transition to the live phase.

    Please note that while there is no dedicated testing environment for the Push API/Inventory solution, you can use the **ClientTest** (CTEST) client for testing purposes.
