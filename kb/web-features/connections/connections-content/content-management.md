:::info Force Content Updates
When performing a "Force Content Now" update to refresh a Seller's portfolio, keep in mind that the duration of the update depends on the **size of the content**. The update is processed through a **queue system** and will begin once it reaches its turn. This could take anywhere from a few minutes to 72 hours.

- If the update hasn't completed after 72 hours, you may attempt the update again.
- Updates within the 72-hour window are considered normal, and there’s no need to contact support until this period has passed.
- **Large updates** (e.g., updating multiple accesses for a Supplier across all Buyers) will result in a longer queue and may take additional time.

If you've followed all the steps and still do not have the most up-to-date content, feel free to [contact our Support Team](https://kb/tickets/guidelines-for-submitting-a-ticket-to-our-support-team.md). We’re here to ensure you have the best possible experience!
