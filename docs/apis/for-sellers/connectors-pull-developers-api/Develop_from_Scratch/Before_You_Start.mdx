:::caution
To ensure a successful implementation, candidates should possess the following foundational knowledge and skills:

1. **Good understanding of the Travel Trade business**: This means knowing how hotels, sellers, and buyers work together, and how they usually deal with their partners.
2. **Experience with C# programming**: You should be comfortable using C#, since it's the main language used in development. It's also important to understand basic software testing (like unit tests and integration tests).
3. **Knowledge of Travelgate's Data Model**: You need to understand how Travelgate organizes data about options, rooms, boards, and policies (see Travelgate’s Business Model). This helps connect everything properly with the seller’s API.

To begin developing a connector, ensure the following are in place:

- Seller's API documentation should be analized and approved by Travelgate
- A GitHub repository will be created by Travelgate, using a predefined template for the integration. This repository will then be shared with you.
- Ensure you have a GitHub account licensed and provided by Travelgate.
- Join the Discord channel—Travelgate will share the link with you.
