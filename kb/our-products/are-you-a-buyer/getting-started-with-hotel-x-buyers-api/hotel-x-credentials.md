# Hotel-X API Credentials

## Review your API Key, Clients, Accesses and Contexts

Once you have configured your account as a Hotel-X Buyer in our Platform, you can access our APP and check your Hotel-X credentials and accesses by following this simple guide:

### Apikey☑️
An Apikey is a unique alphanumeric code that serves as a form of authentication required for accessing Hotel-X API. This key must be included in the HTTP Authorization request header to verify and authenticate the user agent with the server. It acts as a secure identifier, ensuring that only authorized users can make requests and access the API's functionalities. You can find your Apikey (**encrypted**) and generate new ones in section Connections > [API Settings](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/settings).

1. APP access: Log in with your credentials [here](https://www.travelgate.com/).
2. Click on the 'Manage > API Keys' section. You can find it in the menu that appears when you click on your user icon in the top right corner of the screen.
3. API Settings list: List of API Keys associated with your Organization (encrypted). You can also generate new API keys by clicking the 'Create New API Key' button and completing the required form. Once generated, copy the API key value. Remember, this is the only time when the full API key will be displayed, so ensure you store it securely. **The generated API keys are not retrievable**, so if needed, a new one must be created. Previously used API keys will remain active.

	:::info
	Please keep in mind that the Apikey will remain consistent across both test and production environments.

### Access☑️
An access refers to the combination of credentials and authentication configuration that allows a Buyer to establish a connection with a Seller. It serves the purpose of distinguishing between different Sellers and filtering different credentials and configurations from the same Seller (e.g., B2B and B2C feeds). You can check this information in [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections).

For **Hotel-X implementation and testing**, we recommend using the following accesses (they have already been activated on your account and are ready to use):
   * TravelgateX Test Seller (tgx): Access 2 with context HOTELTEST
   * Smyrooms Test: Access 5647 with context LOGITEST

**How can I obtain an access code from an actual Seller?**
To get your access code, simply establish a commercial agreement with the desired Partner and request activation through our website using the [Auto-Activations Form](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).

:::warning important
- Please note it is highly advisable to **avoid making live bookings during the Hotel-X implementation process** until your development has been certified by TravelgateX. dditionally, please make sure to cancel any test bookings and to check that such bookings are refundable.
- To ensure seamless billing, **it's important that you handle all cancellations via our API**. Should you face any issues, please don't hesitate to get in touch with our [Customer Support team](https://app.travelgate.com/support) for assistance.

### Client☑️

A client refers to a party that buys accommodation services through the Hotel-X API implementation. Client codes remain consistent throughout all TravelgateX implementations and they are used to identify the business that is making the request and to confirm that they have a configuration assigned to it.

It is possible to have multiple client codes, for instance, in order to differentiate traffic between B2B and B2C credentials (e.g., client_b2b, client_b2c). As all accesses are compatible with any of your client codes, it is important to use the appropriate one according to your needs. You can find this information in your [API Settings](/kb/connections/connections-settings).

### Context☑️

Context refers to the content codes utilized by both Buyers and Sellers. Each Seller has its own unique context, which may differ between test and production environments. The context includes specific codes for hotels, boards, rooms, etc. You can check this information in [My Connections](https://app.travelgate.com/connections/myconnections). Additionally, when you activate a new Seller, you will receive the context information along with the credentials in the confirmation email.

Buyers have the flexibility to either use their own context or choose content providers. Buyer context codes are generated directly by the Buyer (not provided by Travelgate) and are used in the mapping file names to align the mapping between the Supplier codes and the corresponding codes mapped by the Buyer ([Mapping Plugin](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/plugins/mapping)).

:::info What is the difference between access and context?
The distinction between the two is that an access holds your *credentials* for a specific connection, while a context is the *internal TravelgateX code required to request either the original Supplier hotel codes or your own hotel codes* (previously mapped and uploaded to our SFTP).
