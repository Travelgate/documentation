# Edit Room

## Manage Room Type Changes Efficiently

Editing room types in Inventory is straightforward. Instead of creating a new room type, you can modify an existing one that has already been added to a rate.

### How to Edit a Room Type in a Rate

#### 1. Using an Existing Room Type
- Deselect the current room type from the field list.
- Select a different room type from your master list.

#### 2. Replacing with a New Room Type
- If the required room type is not in your master list, create a new one.
- Provide a **code** and **description** for your reference.
- Save it, and the new room type will be added to your master list, making it available in the **All Room Types** section.


### Can I Modify the Standard Occupancy of a Room in Inventory?

No, **the Standard Occupancy cannot be modified**. To make changes, follow these steps:

1. Delete the affected room(s).
2. Re-add the room(s) with the desired standard occupancy.
3. Contact the Channel Manager to request a remap and reload based on the updated information.

This ensures the changes are correctly applied and reflected in the system.
